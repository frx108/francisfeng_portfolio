2015,Sol LeWitt:Wall Drawing #370,"June 30, 2014–January 28, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/sol-lewitt,"Sol LeWitt (American, 1928–2007) executed drawings by hand throughout his life; in 1968 he extricated his work from the confines of the frame and transferred it directly to the wall. The wall compositions were designed for limited duration and maximum flexibility within a broad range of architectural settings. Initially executed by drafters, these works in their finished state were most often slated for destruction. A seminal practitioner of Conceptual Art, LeWitt emphasized the creative idea that generates a work of art, as opposed to the work's material existence. ""For each work of art that becomes physical,"" he wrote, ""there are many variations that do not."" Sol LeWitt's 1982 Wall Drawing #370: Ten Geometric Figures (including right triangle, cross, X, diamond) with three-inch parallel bands of lines in two directions was installed at the Museum over a period of four weeks. The drawing will be on view in its complete state through January 28, 2018, when it will be painted over. The loan of Wall Drawing #370 is courtesy of The Estate of Sol LeWitt. The installation is made possible by The Modern Circle."
2015,Collecting the Arts of Mexico,"July 17, 2015–September 4, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/collecting-the-arts-of-mexico,"In 1911, Emily Johnston de Forest gave her collection of pottery from Mexico to The Met. Calling it ""Mexican maiolica,"" she highlighted its importance as a North American artistic achievement. De Forest was the daughter of the Museum's first president and, with her husband, Robert, a founder of The American Wing. The De Forests envisioned building a collection of Mexican art, and, even though their ambitions were frustrated at the time, the foundational gift of more than one hundred pieces of pottery anchors The Met's holdings. Today, more than a century later, their vision resonates as the Museum commits to collecting and exhibiting not just the arts of Mexico, but all of Latin America. This exhibition highlights the early contributions of the De Forests and others, and presents recent additions to the collection for the first time."
2015,Asian Art at 100: A History in Photographs,"September 5, 2015–August 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/asian-art-history-in-photographs,"Since The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870, the institution's physical space and collection have grown and its curatorial departments have diversified. The first Asian works of art to enter the collection—mostly ceramics and lacquers—were acquired in 1879 and originally accommodated in what was then called the Department of Decorative Arts. Only in 1915 was a separate Department of Far Eastern Art established, and it was not until 1986 that its name was changed to the Department of Asian Art. The timeline presented in the photographs in this exhibition chronicles the changing face of The Met's galleries of Asian art as the building's footprint has expanded, exhibition styles have evolved, and the collection has grown. Forever a work in progress, The Met's collection of Asian art is ultimately the product of the passion and scholarship of the many collectors, curators, donors, dealers, and directors who have together shaped the Museum's holdings and legacy. #AsianArt100"

2015,Alex Katz at The Met,"October 9, 2015–November 6, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/alex-katz,"This exhibition, mounted in celebration of gifts both donated and promised to the Met, gathers works by Alex Katz (American, born 1927), one of our era's most acclaimed artists. Acquired through the generosity of Glenn Fuhrman, Leonard A. Lauder, and Katz himself, these works—eight in total, including two loans—span nearly the entire arc of Katz's career and include drawings, prints, and paintings. Among the works are two cutouts, the innovative artistic device that Katz pioneered in the late 1950s; a haunting cityscape; several portraits of Ada, Katz's wife and long-time muse; and portraits of luminaries from Katz's own social and artistic circles. Katz was born in Brooklyn in 1927 and came of age as an artist during the heyday of the New York School. In the late 1950s, he began to develop his mature style, one characterized by elegance, simplicity, and stylized abstraction. Committed to depicting recognizable motifs, Katz minimizes details and shading, choosing instead to summarize his subjects with the help of bold contours, blocks of color, and strategic swipes of the brush. As much as they represent a specific person or place, Katz's works also depict the act of seeing itself—that is, the peculiar mechanics of viewing, whether from afar or close up, whether on an empty street or across a crowded room. He captures the surprise and suspense, the desire and pleasure, that accompany the experience of spectatorship. #MetKatz"
2015,Phil Collins:how to make a refugee,"December 11, 2015–November 6, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/phil-collins,"Shot during the Kosovo War (1998Â­–99), how to make a refugee , by British artist Phil Collins (born 1970), addresses the depiction of war victims by journalists and documentarians. Here Collins brings a critical, self-conscious eye to the conventions governing the representation of suffering in the media. In this work, Collins captures the moments just before, during, and after a photo shoot organized by a team of journalists working in a camp in Macedonia. Their subject is a family of Kosovan-Albanian refugees. Over the course of the video, the artist grants very little specific insight into the family and the events that brought them to Macedonia, but provides a great deal of information about how carefully such photo shoots are orchestrated, always with an eye toward manipulating the emotional and political response of viewers. Collins is equally sensitive to the role that cameras play in mediating this relationship—one founded on equal parts suspicion and fascination, exploitation and advocacy—between those who do the depicting and those who are being depicted. Precisely how sitters and creators address one another through and across the camera lens is as much the topic of his video as the Kosovo War and the war refugees themselves. As Collins has said of how to make a refugee : ""A camera brings interested parties together. It attracts and repels according to circumstance or whim . . . You could say that [this work] is driven by an emotional relationship with the subjects, rather than the rational or sensational standards of journalism."""
2015,Masterpieces of Chinese Painting from The Met Collection,"October 31, 2015–October 11, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/masterpieces-of-chinese-painting,"Over the last 40 years, The Met's collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy has grown to be one of the greatest in the world. Replete with masterpieces dating from the Tang dynasty (608–917) to the present, the collection encompasses the vast historical sweep of the brush arts of China, from meticulous court painting to fiercely brushed dragons to lyrical paintings by scholars. This exhibition, presented in two rotations, highlights the gems of the permanent collection in a chronological display, with an emphasis on works from the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1271–1368) dynasties. #ChinesePainting #AsianArt100 The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2015,Design for Eternity: Architectural Models from the Ancient Americas,"October 26, 2015–September 18, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/design-for-eternity,"From the first millennium B.C. until the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century, artists from the ancient Americas created small-scale architectural models to be placed in the tombs of important individuals. These works in stone, ceramic, wood, and metal range from highly abstracted, minimalist representations of temples and houses to elaborate architectural complexes populated with figures. Such miniature structures were critical components in funerary practice and beliefs about an afterlife, and they convey a rich sense of ancient ritual as well as the daily lives of the Aztecs, the Incas, and their predecessors. This exhibition, the first of its kind in the United States, sheds light on the role of these objects in mediating relationships between the living, the dead, and the divine. It also provides a rare look at ancient American architecture, much of which did not survive to the present day. Some 30 remarkable loans from museums in the United States and Peru join works from The Met's permanent collection, which is particularly rich in this material. #DesignforEternity Featured Media Friday Focus ""...a tantalizing exhibition..."" — Wall Street Journal The exhibition is made possible by Jill and Alan Rappaport in honor of Joanne Pearson.

The first—woven in a loop pile meant to suggest a mosaic—has recently been recognized as a wall hanging for Christian liturgical use. The second—five recently acquired elements from a depiction of the Crossing of the Red Sea as described in the book of Exodus—can be understood as being from a wall hanging for Christian or possibly Jewish use. #LiturgicalTextiles
2015,Chinese Lacquer,"August 15, 2015–June 19, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/chinese-lacquer,"Lacquer, the resin of a family of trees found throughout southern China—as well as in Southeast Asia, Korea, and Japan—is an amazing material. When exposed to oxygen and humidity, lacquer hardens or polymerizes, becoming a natural plastic and an ideal protective covering for screens, trays, and other implements. Mixed with pigments, particularly cinnabar (red) and carbon (black), lacquer has been also used as an artistic media for millennia. This installation, which features all of the most important examples of Chinese lacquer in the Museum's collection, explores the laborious techniques used to create scenes based on history and literature, images of popular gods and mythical and real animals, and representations of landscapes and flowers and birds. #ChineseLacquer #AsianArt100 The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of approximately 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 270,000 trade and postcards, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1959 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

The centerpiece of the three-part exhibition is the opulent Worsham-Rockefeller Dressing Room from the New York City house commissioned by art collector and philanthropist Arabella Worsham (later Huntington; ca. 1850–1924). A complete work of art, with its elaborate woodwork and decorations, it is a rare surviving commission by the New York–based cabinetmaker and interior decorator George A. Schastey (American, 1839–1894). Although little known today, Schastey operated a large and successful decorating firm in the late nineteenth century, catering to some of the nation's wealthiest individuals. Loans from public and private collections will highlight his work and important role; some of these works are newly attributed to him and have never before been on public view. The exhibition will also include furniture by some of Schastey's contemporaries. An adjoining gallery will display works by Schastey's best-known competitor, Herter Brothers, that were created for the firm's most important commission, the William H. Vanderbilt House. In total, the exhibition will include more than three dozen examples of furniture from America's Gilded Age.

2015,The Luxury of Time,"November 16, 2015–March 27, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/luxury-of-time,"Time is all around us, displayed on our phones and computers. Today, almost nobody needs to own a watch or a clock to tell the time. Access to the right time is not the luxury it once was. Yet the fascination with clocks and watches persists, and the thriving market for mechanical timekeepers is deeply aware of their history. Clocks and watches have always been about more than just telling time: they have been treasured as objects of desire and wonder, personal items imbued with value that goes beyond pure functionality. As works of art, they represent the marriage of innovation and craftsmanship. This exhibition explores the relationship between the artistry of the exterior form of European timekeepers and the brilliantly conceived technology that they contain. Drawn from the Museum's distinguished collection of German, French, English, and Swiss horology from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century, the extraordinary objects on view show how clocks and watches were made into lavish furniture or exquisite jewelry. The creation of timekeepers required that clockmakers work with cabinetmakers, goldsmiths and silversmiths, enamelers, chasers and gilders, engravers, and even those working in sculpture and porcelain. These craftsmen were tasked with accommodating internal mechanisms by producing cases that, in both shape and function, adapted to timekeeping technologies. Their exteriors are often as complicated as the movements they house. Examining the dialogue between inside and out, adornment and ingenuity, The Luxury of Time reveals the complex evolution of European clockmaking and the central place of timekeepers in the history of decorative arts. #LuxuryofTime Featured Media Pair-Case Watch by Daniel Delander Sunday at The MetâMaking Time: Clocks and Watches The publication is made possible by Marica and Jan Vilcek."
2015,Korea,"February 7, 2015–March 27, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/korea,"When the Department of Far Eastern Art was established at the Metropolitan in the summer of 1915, the Museum possessed only sixty-five Korean works. Some were mistakenly catalogued as Chinese or Japanese. Dubbed the ""hermit kingdom,"" Korea was then little known to the Western world. Today, its traditional arts, as well as pop music, film, and drama, are celebrated markers of global culture. The Museum's collection of Korean art, too, has been significantly transformed and continues to evolve. It now encompasses ceramics, paintings, sculpture, metalwork, lacquer ware, and textiles from the late Bronze Age to the present. Works on view include important recent gifts to the Museum from the Mary Griggs Burke Collection and Florence and Irving Collection—including a rare sixteenth-century Buddhist painting of royal commission, a striking mid-seventeenth-century gilt-wood statue of a Bodhisattva, and exquisite mother-of-pearl inlaid lacquer boxes from the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). The stories behind the objects in this exhibition capture the individuals and trends that shaped the Met's distinctive collection, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally. This presentation also reveals the modern Western imagination of Korea, and the many ways Korean art came to be viewed and appreciated in America. #MetKoreanArt #AsianArt100 The exhibition is made possible by Samsung."
2015,Reconstructions,"September 21, 2015–March 14, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/reconstructions,"This installation, the thirteenth since the Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography opened in 2007, is a snapshot—not comprehensive, but representative—of the collecting interests of the Department of Photographs through recently acquired works made by fifteen artists over the last seven years. While the title is taken from a photograph in the exhibition, the concept of reconstruction chimes with many of the works, which can be viewed, at least in part, as indirect addresses to how perception and cognition are being remapped to accommodate our newly bifurcated existences—online and ""in real life."" The notion that we swim in a sea of photographic images that shape how we see ourselves and the world felt new in 1989 and prescient in 1968, but with the rise of the Internet and social media, this condition is so obvious as to be useless. With one foot in cyberspace and the other on an unstable terrain of accelerated change, our daily life and deepest subjective recesses—our relationship to ourselves, each other, and to things—is constantly being reconstructed along digital lines, with cameras serving as almost bodily appendages to interface between these two realities. In this context, the seamless digital ""restoration"" of dazzle camouflage to a WWII battleship, the viral spread of Photoshop mishaps in an interior view, or the simple folding back of a book page can be seen as complex negotiations between the old order and the new networks that silently and invisibly are shaping individual and collective experience. #MetReconstructions"
2015,The Aftermath of Conflict,"August 24, 2015–March 6, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/jo-ractliffe,"Throughout her career, South African photographer Jo Ractliffe (born 1961) has directed her camera toward landscapes to address themes of displacement, conflict, history, memory, and erasure. This exhibition brings together selected works from three of her recent photographic series that focus on the aftermath of the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002) and its relationship with the Border War (1966–89) fought by South Africans in Angola and present-day Namibia. For Ractliffe and many other South African civilians, Angola during these wars was an abstract place, a ""secret, unspoken location where brothers and boyfriends were sent as part of their military service."" When seen consecutively, these three series reveal Ractliffe's deepening engagement with the region's complex histories as an attempt to ""retrieve a place for memory."" The earliest series, Terreno Ocupado (2007–8), was produced during Ractliffe's first visit to Angola's capital, Luanda, five years after the end of the Civil War. These images highlight the structural instability of the capital's shantytowns and question what it means for land to be occupied, abandoned, and struggled over. While working on As Terras do Fim do Mundo (2009–10), Ractliffe traveled alongside ex-soldiers returning to the desolate places in the Angolan countryside where they had fought. The Borderlands (2011–13) examines the impact of the wars in Angola within South Africa's borders. For this most recent project, she photographed militarized landscapes that had been occupied by the South African army, tracing histories of displacement that began during the colonial and apartheid periods and continue to unfold today. The photographs in all three series were originally produced as either gelatin silver prints or archival pigment prints on cotton paper; the inkjet prints on display here were made by the artist specially for this exhibition. This exhibition has been organized to coincide with Kongo: Power and Majesty , which focuses on works created by artists in present-day Angola between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. #JoRactliffe"

The thematic show features about sixty ensembles of haute couture and ready-to-wear primarily from de Ribes's personal archive, dating from 1962 to the present. Also included are her creations for fancy-dress balls, which she often made by cutting and cannibalizing her haute couture gowns to create nuanced expressions of her aesthetic. These, along with photographs, video, and ephemera, tell the story of how her interest in fashion developed over decades, from childhood ""dress-up"" to the epitome of international style. A muse to haute couture designers, de Ribes had at her disposal their drapers, cutters, and fitters in acknowledgment of their esteem for her taste and originality. Ultimately, she used this talent and experience to create her own successful design business, which she directed from 1982 to 1995. While the exhibition focuses on her taste and style, extensive documentation from her personal archives illustrates the range of her professional life, including her roles as theatrical impresario, television producer, interior designer, and director and organizer of international charity events. #JacquelinedeRibes Featured Media The Designer at Work ""…an eye-opening, perception-changing display of jaw-dropping couture gowns.""— InStyle ""…like walking into a fairy tale…the beauty and exquisite craftsmanship…provide visitors…transportation to a fantasy realm.""— Racked ""…more than just…pretty swaths of fabrics.

2015,Celebrating Sax,"November 6, 2014–February 21, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/celebrating-sax,"This special display of instruments made by three generations of the Sax family marks the bicentenary of the birth of Adolphe Sax. Rare saxophones, brass instruments, and an exquisite ivory clarinet are among the twenty-six instruments selected to showcase the inventions and innovations of this important family. There are few instrument makers who have become a household name. The eponymous instruments of Adolphe Sax have had a wide-reaching impact on music and society. Patented in 1846 and conceived as a military band and orchestral instrument, the saxophone is now integral to many different types of music around the world. Through jazz and pop, it achieved the type of universal popularity matched by few other instruments. During Sax's life, military and band music were transformed by saxhorns, his innovative family of brass instruments. The saxhorn fueled the brass band movement, which opened up music making to the working classes. Modern day euphoniums, tenor horns, and baritones are all descendants of the saxhorn family. The bicentenary of Adolphe Sax's birth also marks the 125th anniversary of the gift of over 3,600 instruments to the Met by the pioneering collector Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown. Sax was also an avid collector, active during a formative period of musical instrument scholarship. Many important instrument collections were established during his lifetime, including the one at the Metropolitan Museum. Sax and Brown circulated in the same international community of scholars and collectors, and instruments made by the Sax family featured prominently in Brown's collection as examples of cutting-edge instrument design. They continue to inspire performers, composers, and instrument makers."

While these are notably functional samplers, even with more decorative examples, the maker's skill and creativity were tempered by her adherence to traditional patterns, passed down over the years by means of earlier samplers, patterns books, or instructional manuals. Samplers were made as part of a young woman's education, either at a formal school or under informal tutelage at home. Through most of the eighteenth century, in both Europe and America, most girls were expected to learn only practical skills—basic reading, writing, and sums, along with sewing and cooking—to prepare them for their roles as wives, mothers, and homemakers. The Museum has more than eight hundred samplers from Europe and North America. The survival of so many of these embroideries indicates a continuing appreciation for the skill they demonstrate, for their charming variations on a theme, and, perhaps most of all, for the names of the makers, which were proudly added to many of these pieces when their work was done. For many, these samplers are the only remaining trace of the lives they lived. This installation is designed to complement Fashion and Virtue: Textile Patterns and the Print Revolution, 1520–1620 , on view October 20, 2015–January 10, 2016."

Verona's location at a significant crossroads between northern Italy and northern Europe encouraged Girolamo dai Libri and the members of the vibrant Veronese school to synthesize various influences, fusing the sculptural, classicizing style of nearby Padua, the luminous sensibility of Venetian painting, and the meticulous attention to naturalistic detail inspired by northern European artists. The focal point of this installation, comprised of works from the Museum's collection, is Girolamo's majestic altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with saints, on loan to the Robert Lehman Collection from the Department of European Paintings. Highlighting Girolamo's dual activities as a painter and illuminator, this altarpiece will be shown alongside manuscripts by Girolamo and his Veronese contemporaries, as well as drawings by this circle of artists."

2015,Grand Illusions,"August 10, 2015–January 18, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/grand-illusions,"Photographers, like ventriloquists, can cast ""voices"" in a seemingly infinite number of genres and period styles. This does not negate the camera's direct relationship to the world—tying image to subject as naturally as a footprint—but instead reveals that photographs are always admixtures of fiction and reality tilted toward one end of the scale or the other. This survey of the ways in which photographers invent their images is not definitive or complete, but instead suggests the varieties of experience available to photography when the imaginary is pictured as if it were real. The selection also points toward photography's inherently promiscuous relationship with other mediums such as literature and film, not to mention its persuasive powers when used in advertising. The artists of our era, raised on the fictions of postwar consumer culture, use the assumed truthfulness of photography against itself to question how we think we know the world, the past, and ourselves. Leaving off at the end of the analog era, this survey brings the viewer to the precipice of a brave new world of digital manipulation that is bound to become ever more seamless to the naked eye."
2015,"Pattern, Color, Light","July 20, 2015–January 10, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/pattern-color-light,"This exhibition features examples of architectural ornament from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey that were found at sites ranging in date from approximately 500 to 1000. Few buildings from this period survive fully intact, but the pieces of walls, ceilings, and floors that remain shed light on the ingenious ways that artisans created sumptuous interiors and stately facades. Far from being mere embellishment, the decorative programs to which these pieces belonged were pivotal in creating memorable experiences for viewers, whether conveying the power of a patron or the depth of a religious concept. The presentation includes objects from the departments of Islamic Art , Ancient Near Eastern Art , and Medieval Art and The Cloisters , highlighting interconnections between works that are traditionally displayed apart. While the Near East witnessed significant social and political changes during the period from 500 to 1000, including the rise of Islam and the collapse of the Sasanian Empire, the objects on display attest to the persistence of certain artistic ideas across religious and political boundaries. These include the use of an established repertoire of vegetal and geometric patterns to enliven walls, the application of vibrant color schemes to architectural surfaces through polychrome painting and dyed textiles, and a fascination with bright, jewel-like materials such as polished marble and glass mosaic. These enduring aesthetic concepts, which informed architectural style for more than half a millennium, are explored further through the lens of the exhibition's three themes: pattern, color, and light. The exhibition is made possible by The Hagop Kevorkian Fund."
2015,Andrea del Sarto'sBorgherini Holy Family,"October 14, 2015–January 10, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/andrea-del-sarto-borgherini,"This focused exhibition presents new findings on the Metropolitan Museum's Holy Family with the Young Saint John the Baptist , one of the Museum's greatest works of the Italian Renaissance. The Metropolitan's painting is shown alongside Charity (before 1530), a closely related panel on loan from the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. The exhibition allows visitors to follow the artist's approach as he moved from drawings on paper to the preparatory underdrawings on the panels, and then to the final paintings, emphasizing the crucial role of drawings and cartoons in his workshop. The exhibition will complement Andrea del Sarto: The Renaissance Workshop in Action , a more extensive survey of the artist's work on view at The Frick Collection at the same time. Andrea del Sarto (1486–1530) was one of the most influential artists active in Florence in the first decades of the sixteenth century. He painted the grand Holy Family with the Young Saint John the Baptist around 1528 for Giovanni Borgherini, who was prominent during the city's tumultuous, short-lived Republic, before the Medici family reestablished its rule. The imagery of Christ sharing the orb with his cousin Saint John the Baptist, Florence's patron saint, was symbolic for the Republican government. Recent technical examination and conservation of the painting have revealed the masterful underdrawing of the figures and the brilliant, sumptuous color that led Sarto to be known as ""the painter without defects."" The exhibition examines Sarto's decision to adapt this composition for the related panel Charity , which was likely meant as an important gift for Francis I, the French king.

2015,Fashion and Virtue,"October 20, 2015–January 10, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/fashion-and-virtue,"Printed sources related to the design of textile patterns first appeared during the Renaissance. Six intricate interlaced designs, attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and later copied by Albrecht Dürer, stood at the beginning of a fruitful international exchange of pattern designs through print. From the 1520s, small booklets with textile patterns were published regularly. These pocket-sized, easy-to-use publications became an instant success and essentially formed the first fashion publications. This interdisciplinary exhibition, drawn largely from the Metropolitan Museum's own collection, combines printed pattern books, drawings, textile samples, costumes, paintings, and various other works of art to evoke the colorful world in which the Renaissance textile pattern books first emerged and functioned.

The magnificently lit, twenty-foot blue spruce looms over a vivid eighteenth-century Neapolitan Nativity scene, enshrined in an abundant array of lifelike figures with silk-robed angels hovering above. The scene describes in detail the Mediterranean harbor town's multicultural society. The installation is set in front of the eighteenth-century Spanish choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid in the Museum's Medieval Sculpture Hall. Recorded Christmas music adds to the enjoyment of the holiday display. Please note: There are no tree-lighting ceremonies scheduled this year due to the European Paintings Skylights Project .

2015,Kongo: Power and Majesty,"September 18, 2015–January 3, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/kongo,"Central Africa's Kongo civilization is responsible for one of the world's greatest artistic traditions. This international loan exhibition explores the region's history and culture through 146 of the most inspired creations of Kongo masters from the late fifteenth through the early twentieth century. The earliest of these creations were diplomatic missives sent by Kongo sovereigns to their European counterparts during the Age of Exploration; they took the form of delicately carved ivories and finely woven raffia cloths embellished with abstract geometric patterns. Admired as marvels of human ingenuity, such Kongo works were preserved in princely European Kunstkammer , or cabinets of curiosities, alongside other precious and exotic creations from across the globe. With works drawn from sixty institutional and private lenders across Europe and the United States, Kongo: Power and Majesty relates the objects on view to specific historical developments and challenges misconceptions of Africa's relationship with the West. In doing so, it offers a radical, new understanding of Kongo art over the last five hundred years. #KongoPower Featured Media ""… splendid, thought-provoking exhibition""— Wall Street Journal ""This rigorous and unshowily erudite exhibition … is that rarest thing: a scholarly blockbuster.""— The Guardian ""Curator Alisa LaGamma … has fused aesthetics, history, ethnography and spectacle into an exhibition that is at once entertaining and serious, shocking and deeply satisfying.""— Financial Times The exhibition is made possible by the Gail and Parker Gilbert Fund and the Diane W. and James E.

2015,In and Out of the Studio,"August 31, 2015–January 3, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/in-and-out-of-the-studio,"This exhibition presents one hundred years of portrait photography in West Africa through nearly eighty photographs taken between the 1870s and the 1970s. These works, many of which are being shown for the first time, are drawn from the Metropolitan Museum's Visual Resource Archives in the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas , with additions from the Department of Photographs . The installation seeks to expand our understanding of West African portrait photography by rendering the broad variety of these practices and aesthetics. It juxtaposes photographs, postcards, real photo postcards, and original negatives taken both inside and outside the studio by amateur and professional photographers active from Senegal to Cameroon and from Mali to Gabon. Among them are renowned artists such as Seydou Keïta, J. D. 'Okhai Ojeikere, and Samuel Fosso, as well as lesser-known practitioners who worked at the beginning of the century, including George A. G. Lutterodt, the Lisk-Carew Brothers, and Alex A. Acolatse. These photographers explored the possibilities of their medium, developing a rich aesthetic vocabulary through compelling self-portraits, staged images against painted backdrops or open landscapes, and casual snapshots of leisurely times. Regardless of their unique place in the history of photography in West Africa—from the formality of the earlier studio poses to the theatricality of Fosso's fantasies—the sitter's self-assured and unabashed presence fully engages the viewer. Photography allowed artists and patrons alike to express their articulation of what modernity looked like—one that was constantly reinvented."
2015,Arms and Armor,"November 11, 2014–January 3, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/art-of-collecting-arms-and-armor,"The permanent collection of the Department of Arms and Armor is one of the most encyclopedic in the world. To highlight the ongoing development of the collection's multicultural and interdisciplinary nature, this exhibition focuses on approximately forty works from Europe, the United States, Japan, India, and Tibet acquired between 2003 and 2014. Beyond the well-established categories of finely decorated armor, edged weapons, and firearms, the selection features drawings and prints, textiles, and other materials that are vital, but often unrecognized, aspects of the understanding and appreciation of arms and armor as a universal art form. Works on paper, textiles, and other select pieces will be rotated two to three times during the course of the exhibition."
2015,About Face,"July 27–December 13, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/about-face,"The representation of human emotion through facial expression has interested western artists since antiquity. Drawn from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collections of drawings, prints, and photographs, the diverse works in this installation, ranging from portraits and caricatures to representations of theater and war, reveal how expression underpinned narrative and provided a window onto the character and motivations of the subjects, the artists, and even their audience. Anchored by Charles Le Brun's Expressions of the Passions ( Caractères des passions ) and Guillaume-Benjamin-Armand Duchenne de Boulogne and Adrien Tournachon's photographic series The Workings of Human Physiognomy ( Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine ), this selection of works, dating from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century, traces the means through which artists such as Hans Hoffman, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Thomas Rowlandson, and Francisco Goya explored the animated human face.

2015,Wolfgang Tillmans,"January 26–November 15, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/wolfgang-tillmans,"Wolfgang Tillmans's installation Book for Architects (2014) is on view at the Metropolitan Museum for the first time since its debut at the 2014 Venice Architecture Biennale. Over a period of ten years, Tillmans (German, born 1968) photographed buildings in thirty-seven countries on five continents to produce Book for Architects . The 450 photographs are presented in a site-specific, two-channel video installation projected onto perpendicular walls. Book for Architects shows architecture through the eyes of the artist. Tillmans seeks to express the complexity, irrationality, madness, and beauty found in quotidian buildings, street patterns, and fragments of spaces. He achieves this from a technical standpoint by using standard lenses, which most closely approximate the perspective of the naked eye. Additionally, Tillmans designs the experience of the exhibition in the installation space itself—from the proximity and arrangement of the projected images to the seating, which is designed in a bleacher-like arrangement to enable a range of perspectives and views of the work. Through this cyclic series of photographs of largely anonymous building exteriors, interiors, city shots, and street views, Tillmans presents a personal portrait of contemporary architecture that will be familiar to everyone. This installation is made possible by The Modern Circle."
2015,Paintings by George Stubbs from the Yale Center for British Art,"April 6–November 8, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/george-stubbs,"Eight paintings by George Stubbs (1724–1806) have been lent to the Metropolitan Museum by the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, while its Louis I. Kahn building is closed for renovation until 2016. The works are shown together with British old master paintings from the permanent collection. Stubbs's sporting pictures form part of the most important collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. Numbering more than two thousand paintings, and many thousands of drawings, watercolors, prints, rare books, and manuscripts, the collection was formed by Paul Mellon (1907–1999) and presented by him to Yale University. Mellon particularly admired the sensitive, highly observant artist, and bought his first Stubbs in 1936. He eventually owned nearly two hundred of the artist's works. Mellon's enthusiasm for the once-neglected Stubbs led to a major reassessment of the artist's achievement. Stubbs, the son of a Liverpool currier, was self taught. In the 1740s he made anatomical drawings at York County Hospital. In the later 1750s he dissected and minutely examined the carcasses of horses, preparing detailed studies which he took with him when he moved to London about 1759. The drawings of the anatomy of the horse probably won him his first major commissions. He painted the famous Whistlejacket (National Gallery, London) and, in 1762, Horse Attacking a Lion (Yale Center for British Art), both for the Marquis of Rockingham. He also prepared all of the engravings for the 1766 book Anatomy of the Horse . Stubbs depicted both figures and a wide variety of animals with an uncommon awareness of their particular qualities. We welcome the opportunity to show such fine examples of sporting art, particularly as the genre is largely unrepresented in the Metropolitan's collection.

2015,The Roof Garden Commission: Pierre Huyghe,"May 12–November 1, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/pierre-huyghe,"This spring Pierre Huyghe (born 1962, Paris) has installed the third in a new series of site-specific commissions for the Museum's Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden. Huyghe has spent the past twenty-five years experimenting across media to create ritualistic, engaging encounters with art. His practice extends beyond the use of traditional art forms like drawing and film to materials uncommon in a fine-arts context, including living animals, plants, and other natural elements. At the Met, his project explores the transformation of cultural and biological systems through a dynamic gathering of components derived from the Museum's collection, architecture, and surroundings. Related Installation Pierre Huyghe: Human Mask—on view from April 27 through August 9, 2015, in gallery 916 —presents the New York premiere of Huyghe's new nineteen-minute video, Untitled (Human Mask) , which portrays a mysterious creature's resilience in the aftermath of natural and man-made disaster.

Salgo (1914–2005), a Hungarian native and former United States ambassador to Budapest, was fascinated by the art of the goldsmith in Hungarian culture and formed his own ""treasury"" by collecting pieces that are individual and unique. This exhibition celebrates the gift to the Metropolitan Museum of the major part of the silver collection assembled by this focused collector over three decades. This large collection of silver—about 120 pieces, most dating from the fifteenth to the late eighteenth century—comprises a variety of types with especially refined appearance and high levels of craftsmanship, representing Hungarian silver at its best. The earliest works in the Salgo Collection are two rare medieval chalices ornamented with colorful filigree enamel. The intriguing shapes, inventive decoration, and historical importance of the objects—products of once-prosperous local aristocratic dynasties—make this ensemble exceptional. As a result of this generous gift, the Metropolitan Museum is now the only museum outside Hungary to possess such an array of sumptuous goldsmiths' work from the region. #HungarianTreasure Read blog posts related to this exhibition on Now at the Met .

2015,Scenes from the Life of St. Martin,"May 11–October 25, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/life-of-saint-martin,"This installation features a series of rare fifteenth-century embroideries illustrating scenes from the life of Saint Martin (316–397), on display for the first time. These splendid examples of Franco-Flemish embroidery—in which detailed pictorial designs and luminous palettes were created by colored silk and metallic threads—highlight the sophistication of this highly prized medium. The seven embroideries on view, drawn from the Robert Lehman Collection and The Cloisters Collection, were part of a much larger ensemble, thirty-six of which are now dispersed among public and private collections. Probably removed from their original fabric support in the seventeenth century, they may have adorned a liturgical vestment, an altar frontal, or possibly a combination of the two, constituting a set of vestments. The installation includes a liturgical garment (a chasuble) with embroidered roundels, which serves to illustrate the context in which the Saint Martin series may have first appeared. The Saint Martin embroideries were probably designed by artists (several hands have been identified) from France or the Lowlands during the early fifteenth century. It is likely that a painter provided the design for the needlework, which was then carried out by specialized embroiderers. The embroideries share stylistic parallels with contemporary French and Flemish painting and manuscript illumination. While the patron remains unknown, Philip the Good of Burgundy, Pope Martin V, King Charles VII of France, and René d'Anjou—all of whom commissioned elaborate needlework—have been identified as possible patrons of this significant ensemble. The series could have been intended for a set of vestments for the Basilica of Saint Martin at Tours, the site of the Saint's tomb, or one of the many other churches dedicated to him. Saint Martin, born in present-day Hungary in the early fourth century, left the Roman army to devote his life to the Christian faith. He lived mostly in France, where he founded one of the earliest monastic establishments (near Poitiers) and became Bishop of Tours. An important figure in Western monasticism and a patron saint of France, Martin was a highly venerated saint known for performing miracles, as illustrated in several of the embroideries."
2015,Selections from the Collection of Jefferson R. Burdick,"April 9–October 20, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/burdick-collection-april-rotation,"The Burdick baseball card collection constitutes an integral part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of ephemera and tells the history of popular printmaking in the United States. In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of approximately thirty thousand baseball cards in large batches, along with another 270,000 trade and postcards, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1959 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."
2015,Treasures and Talismans,"May 1–October 18, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/treasures-and-talismans,"Rings are one of the oldest and most familiar forms of bodily adornment. Worn by both women and men, they serve as declarations of status, markers of significant life events, expressions of identity, and protective talismans. They also have been a source of boundless invention for goldsmiths and their clients. The rings featured in this exhibition come from the Griffin Collection, named after the mythical creature that is part lion and part eagle. In medieval lore, the griffin was often a guardian of treasure and was known to seek out gold in rocks. While the collection includes finger rings from across the ages, our selection focuses specifically on objects made in the ancient, medieval, and Renaissance periods. These were especially innovative moments in the development of finger rings, and the wide variety of designs on view testifies to the creative energy of premodern goldsmiths. Related works from the Metropolitan's collection highlight the connections between rings and other works of art, such as painting, metalwork, and manuscript illumination. Exploring the making of rings from raw material to finished product and from goldsmith to owner, this exhibition will highlight rings as both physical objects and works of art. The significance of rings in the lives of medieval and Renaissance people will be a featured topic. Also discussed will be the connection of rings to religion, superstition, love, marriage, and identity.

The selection showcases the creativity of eighty-eight prekindergarten through grade 12 students from all five boroughs and includes paintings, prints, sculptures, photographs, mixed-media works, collages, and drawings. Each piece demonstrates personal expression, imaginative use of media, close observation, and an understanding of artistic processes. This juried exhibition is also a celebration of public school achievement in the arts. Dedicated art teachers support students' creativity and help them look closely in order to respond to their worlds through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and delve more deeply into their imaginations. We received over 900 submissions, which a panel of arts specialists from the Department of Education and Studio in a School narrowed down to 370 semifinalists. A jury of distinguished members of the New York City arts community, including staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, chose the eighty-eight works on display in P.S. Art 2015 .

2015,Sargent: Portraits of Artists and Friends,"June 30–October 4, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/sargent-portraits-of-artists-and-friends,"Throughout his career, the celebrated American painter John Singer Sargent (1856–1925) created exceptional portraits of artists, writers, actors, dancers, and musicians, many of whom were his close friends. As a group, these portraits—many of which were not commissioned—are often highly charged, intimate, witty, idiosyncratic, and more experimental than his formal portraiture. Brilliant works of art and penetrating character studies, they are also records of relationships, influences, aspirations, and allegiances. Sargent: Portraits of Artists and Friends brings together ninety-two of the artist's paintings and drawings of members of his impressive artistic circle. The individuals seen through Sargent's eyes represent a range of leading figures in the creative arts of the time such as artists Claude Monet and Auguste Rodin, writers Robert Louis Stevenson and Henry James, and the actor Ellen Terry, among others. The exhibition features some of Sargent's most celebrated full-length portraits ( Dr. Pozzi at Home , Hammer Museum), his dazzling subject paintings created in the Italian countryside ( Group with Parasols [Siesta] , private collection), and brilliant watercolors ( In the Generalife , The Metropolitan Museum of Art) alongside lesser-known portrait sketches of his intimate friends ( Vernon Lee , 1881, Tate).

2015,Navigating the West,"June 17–September 20, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/navigating-the-west,"One of the foremost American genre painters of the nineteenth century, George Caleb Bingham is best known for his compelling depictions of frontier life along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This exhibition brings together for the first time sixteen of Bingham's iconic river paintings, with such highlights as The Jolly Flatboatmen (1846; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), exploring them as an extraordinary artistic series that chronicles the process of civilizing the nation by transforming the western wilderness. As an entrepreneurial effort, Bingham's series harnessed the fluid social worlds of the inland rivers and addressed the expectations of regional and national audiences during the 1840s and 1850s. Over forty of Bingham's masterful preparatory drawings are included in the exhibition, enabling audiences to witness firsthand the artist's in-depth study and preparation for his paintings. The newly discovered underdrawings for Bingham's celebrated masterpiece Fur Traders Descending the Missouri (1845) are a special feature. The project includes an innovative technical study comparing findings from state-of-the-art infrared analysis of the paintings with in-depth studies of the figural preparatory drawings, revealing how Bingham's meticulous creative methods resulted in compositions and characters that told carefully crafted stories on canvas. This dynamic exhibition reveals not only how the Mississippi and Missouri rivers advanced the integration of the West into a national narrative, but how Bingham's paintings claim a place for western character and identity in shaping the United States.

2015,Warriors and Mothers,"December 9, 2014–September 16, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/warriors-and-mothers,"The figures created by Mbembe master carvers from southeastern Nigeria are among the earliest and most visually dramatic wood sculptures preserved from sub-Saharan Africa. Created between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, and striking for their synthesis of intense rawness and poetry, these representations of seated figures—mothers nurturing their offspring and aggressive male warriors—were originally an integral part of monumental carved drums positioned at the epicenter of spiritual life, the heartbeat of Mbembe communities. When these electrifying creations were presented for the first time in a Paris gallery in 1974, they immediately caught the attention of the art world. That exhibition was a groundbreaking event that revealed a tradition unlike any that had defined African art until then. Dispersed internationally among private and institutional collections, these works will be reunited in New York for the first time in this exhibition.

2015,China: Through the Looking Glass,"May 7–September 7, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/china-through-the-looking-glass,"ä¸­æ This exhibition explores the impact of Chinese aesthetics on Western fashion and how China has fueled the fashionable imagination for centuries. In this collaboration between The Costume Institute and the Department of Asian Art , high fashion is juxtaposed with Chinese costumes, paintings, porcelains, and other art, including films, to reveal enchanting reflections of Chinese imagery. From the earliest period of European contact with China in the sixteenth century, the West has been enchanted with enigmatic objects and imagery from the East, providing inspiration for fashion designers from Paul Poiret to Yves Saint Laurent, whose fashions are infused at every turn with romance, nostalgia, and make-believe. Through the looking glass of fashion, designers conjoin disparate stylistic references into a pastiche of Chinese aesthetic and cultural traditions. The exhibition features more than 140 examples of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear alongside Chinese art. Filmic representations of China are incorporated throughout to reveal how our visions of China are framed by narratives that draw upon popular culture, and also to recognize the importance of cinema as a medium through which to understand the richness of Chinese history. #ChinaLookingGlass #AsianArt100 ""…the exhibition…offers a thoughtful, expressive, and…utterly breathtaking exploration of China.""— Washington Post ""A multimedia extravaganza that moves between quiet contemplation and brilliant visual assault.""— Wall Street Journal ""'CHINA through the Looking Glass' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a spectacular new show.""— The Economist The exhibition is made possible by Additional support is provided by and several Chinese donors."
2015,"Coptic Art, Dikran Kelekian, and Milton Avery","August 11, 2014–September 7, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/coptic-art,"A 1943 portrait by the renowned modern American painter Milton Avery (1885–1965) of his friend Dikran Kelekian—a noted collector of modern paintings, Coptic, and Islamic art, and an influential dealer in Middle Eastern art of all periods—is the centerpiece of this installation. It is shown alongside twenty textiles and decorative objects created in Egypt between 300 and 800 A.D. Many are from the collection of works from Egypt that Kelekian began to acquire in the late 1800s. In addition to textile fragments, the installation includes a statuette, a necklace, and a comb. The presentation presents one example of Kelekian's success in encouraging contemporary artists to become interested in ancient art, especially Coptic art. Avery depicts the dealer before a background decorated with sketchily drawn Coptic textile patterns that are arranged as if roughly sewn together into a hanging. The motifs are similar to those on works in the exhibition. Kelekian's generation called the works Coptic in reference to Egypt's dominant Christian community at the time they were discovered in burial sites in the late nineteenth century. Their motifs referring to Greek and Roman mythology were associated with the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. Recent research places these works within the larger sphere of Mediterranean culture, as they are displayed at the Met, rather than limiting them to being an Egyptian Coptic phenomenon. Dikran Garabed Kelekian (1868–1951) was born in the Armenian community in Kayseri, when it was an important city of the Ottoman Empire. After opening a gallery in Istanbul in 1892, he showed ""Persian"" works at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. He and his brother Kevork went on to establish galleries in Paris, London, Cairo, and New York that attracted the major collectors of their time. He cultivated friendships with artists including Milton Avery as well as Mary Cassatt, Marsden Hartley, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and John Singer Sargent, among others. His American clients included such collectors as George Blumenthal, H. O. and Louisine Havemeyer (whom he escorted through Egypt), and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (to whom he sold monumental friezes from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud, which Rockefeller eventually gave to the Metropolitan Museum). A small faience statue of a hippopotamus—the Museum's unofficial mascot, known as ""William""—was also owned by Kelekian before it was acquired by the Metropolitan. Milton Avery (1885–1965) was an American artist who came to Kelekian's attention in the dealer's old age. Avery and his friend Marsden Hartley knew Kelekian while he was in New York. Avery's portrait of Kelekian was first shown in the exhibition Kelekian as the Artist Sees Him , held at the Durand-Ruel Galleries in New York in 1944."
2015,Maurice Prendergast,"June 1–September 7, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/maurice-prendergast,"From 1895 to 1897, Maurice Prendergast filled the pages of a folio album with drawings in watercolor, pencil, and pen and ink, sketched on-site in the Boston Public Garden. His radiant images captured the carefree recreation of cossetted children and their adoring families in beguiling snapshots. Several of the sketches originated ideas for advertisements, while others laid out subjects for monotype printmaking. The album, later called the Large Boston Public Garden Sketchbook , very likely served as a presentation piece for publishers and other clients. Born in Newfoundland, Canada, Prendergast (1858–1924) spent much of his life in Boston, where the picturesque landscapes and seascapes in and around the vibrant city provided the perfect setting for his now-familiar repertoire of leisured subjects at play. Armed with portable watercolors, Prendergast could slip in and out of a beachfront crowd or a promenading family in the park unnoticed. In 1961, Robert Lehman bought the Large Boston Public Garden Sketchbook from the widow of Prendergast's brother, Charles. When the binding was examined, there was evidence of deterioration from mold, and it was then decided to dismantle the album to ensure the preservation of its drawings. This exhibition displays all of the watercolors and several drawings, a fitting tribute to an American artist whose colorful imagery chronicled charming pastimes in and around his beloved city."
2015,Van Gogh: Irises and Roses,"May 12–August 16, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/van-gogh," Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) brought his work in Provence to a close with exuberant bouquets of spring flowers—two of irises and two of roses, in contrasting formats and color schemes—in which he sought to impart a ""calm, unremitting ardor"" to his ""last touch of the brush."" Painted on the eve of his departure from the asylum at Saint-Rémy and conceived as a series or ensemble on a par with the Sunflower decoration painted earlier in Arles, the group includes the Metropolitan Museum's Irises and Roses and their counterparts: the upright Irises from the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, and the horizontal Roses from the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. This exhibition will reunite the four paintings for the first time since the artist's death and is timed to coincide with the blooming of the flowers that captured his attention. It will open 125 years to the week that Van Gogh announced to his brother Theo, on May 11 and 13, 1890, that he was working on these ""large bouquets,"" and will provide a singular opportunity to reconsider Van Gogh's artistic aims and the impact of dispersal and color fading on his intended results.

2015,Fatal Attraction,"March 17–August 16, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/fatal-attraction-piotr-uklanski,"Since emerging in the mid-1990s, the New York–based artist Piotr UklaÅski (born Poland, 1968) has worked with a wide variety of materials, from eye-popping collages made with pencil shavings and motley assemblages of fiber and crockery to paintings made with tie-dye or globs of brightly colored resin. This exhibition, the first to survey UklaÅski's photography, locates his work with the camera at the center of his artistic practice. Reveling in moribund or marginal artistic languages from a position at once ironic and sincere, the artist simultaneously subverts and pays homage to defunct modes of expression. UklaÅski's underappreciated yet historically significant series The Joy of Photography (1997–2007) explores clichés of popular photography using the kitschy subjects and hackneyed effects of Eastman Kodak's how-to manual for the serious amateur. Whereas artists of the 1980s like Richard Prince appropriated such images by rephotographing them to reveal their constructed nature, UklaÅski remade them in a manner akin to slightly irreverent cover versions of songs that bring out hidden or repressed aspects of his source material. In this way, the artist both acknowledges appropriation's endgame—that there are no new pictures under the sun—while creating a space for the creation of new works."

The diamond-rich region attracted artists, poets, writers, and traders from all over the world—including Iran, Turkey, Africa, and Europe—who were drawn to the Shi’a culture and material splendor of the courts. Under their mixed influence, captivating art styles of otherworldly charm evolved. At its zenith, the Deccan became home to Indian and Persian artists, the abode of African elites, and the place where European discoverers embraced new tastes in textiles and gems. By the end of the seventeenth century, the Deccan courts gave way to Mughal domination from the north, but their preceding efflorescence offers a glimpse of the imaginative heights reached in the arts of painting. This exhibition brings together some two hundred of the finest works from major international, private, and royal collections. Featuring many remarkable loans from India, the exhibition—which is the most comprehensive museum presentation on this subject to date—explores the unmistakable character of classical Deccani art in various media: poetic lyricism in painting, lively creations in metalwork, and a distinguished tradition of textile production. #DeccanSultans ""Beautiful, sometimes heart-rending show""— New York Times The exhibition is made possible by the Gail and Parker Gilbert Fund, the Placido Arango Fund, the E.

2015,Robert Motherwell,"February 2–July 26, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/robert-motherwell,"In addition to a long and prolific career as a painter, American artist Robert Motherwell (1915–1991) was a dedicated teacher, a scholar of art and literature, and a champion of fellow artists. He was the youngest member of the ""New York School"" of Abstract Expressionists, whose name he coined and for whom he was a theorist and spokesman. With his wide array of intellectual interests—from French Symbolist poetry to philosophy, music, and modernist painting—Motherwell provided a critical link between European artists and his American contemporaries. The works in this gallery have been assembled from the permanent collection and from the holdings of the Dedalus Foundation, founded by Motherwell in 1981, to mark the centenary of the artist's birth and to convey the broad range of his artistic activity, from monumental paintings (his work is also installed in gallery 920 ), to collages, prints, and illustrated books."
2015,Elaborate Embroidery,"February 2–July 19, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/elaborate-embroidery,"This installation features lengths of fabric for an unmade man's suit and waistcoat, as well as a selection of embroidery samples for fashionable menswear made between about 1760 and 1815. During this period, France was the undisputed epicenter of the European fashionable world, and professional embroidery workshops there produced a dizzying array of colorful designs from which a man could choose. The installation features a copy of L'Art du Brodeur ( The Art of the Embroiderer ), which was published in Paris in 1770. This book contains detailed descriptions about subjects such as preparing fabric to be embroidered and the variety of threads used in a workshop, as well as illustrations of designs for men's suits. Seen together, the fabrics and the book provide a glimpse into the world of vividly colored and highly decorative fashion that was a key component of an upper-class European man's life in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries."

Also on display are drawings by Edward Detmold (British, 1883–1957) of subjects from Arabian Nights , as well as works by John Linnell (British, 1792–1882). A selection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European drawings and prints celebrates the music of Mozart, particularly his operas. Prints after the Renaissance master Michelangelo Buonarroti—executed by Marcantonio Raimondi (Italian, ca. 1480–before 1534), Giulio Bonasone (Italian, active 1531–after 1576), Nicholas Beatrizet, and others—demonstrate Michelangelo's wide artistic range as a painter, sculptor, draftsman, and architect. These works played an essential role in disseminating Michelangelo's art in the sixteenth century. A selection of drawings focuses on the close relationship between humans and horses and includes recent acquisitions by artists ranging from Fra Bartolomeo (Italian, 1473–1517), Philip Wouwerman (Dutch, 1619–1668), and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (Italian, 1696–1770) to Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881–1973). A related grouping of sixteenth-century German prints centers on Hans Baldung's Group of Seven Horses (1534) and demonstrates how Albrecht Dürer (German, 1471–1528) and Lucas Cranach (German, 1472–1553) employed similar motifs to very different ends. Finally, German woodcuts by Albrecht Altdorfer (German, ca. 1480–1538) and Michael Ostendorfer (German, ca. 1490–1549) focus on the consequences of the expulsion of the Jews from Regensburg in 1519."

Made in the early 1490s for the tomb of Doge Andrea Vendramin, it is the only signed sculpture from that monumental complex. The serene, idealized figure, inspired by ancient sculpture, is deceptively complex. Carefully manipulating composition and finish, Tullio created God's perfect human being, but also the anxious victim of the serpent's wiles. In 2002, Adam was gravely damaged in an accident. Committed to returning it to public view, the Museum undertook a conservation treatment that has restored the sculpture to its original appearance to the fullest extent possible. The exhibition allows Adam to be viewed in the round and explains this unprecedented twelve-year research and conservation project. It also inaugurates a new permanent gallery for Venetian and northern Italian sculpture.

2015,Fatal Attraction,"March 17–June 14, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/piotr-uklanski-selects,"This installation of works from the permanent collection was organized by the New York–based artist Piotr UklaÅski (born Poland, 1968), whose photographs are on view in the current exhibition Fatal Attraction: Piotr UklaÅski Photographs . His chosen theme is Eros and Thanatos—the intertwined concepts of life force and death wish that Sigmund Freud interpreted as warring within each individual and within Western civilization as a whole. Although long since discredited as psychological truth, Eros and Thanatos is a hardy cultural construct—from the quintessentially French description of climax as ""la petite morte"" to Richard Wagner's ""Liebestod"" from Tristan und Isolde to Woody Allen's Love and Death . While some aspect of love or death could describe a sizable percentage of the Met's collection, UklaÅski largely eschewed the obvious—the death throes of saints and heroes or staples of erotica such as Japanese woodcuts—in the loans from eleven curatorial departments that comprise the exhibition. The artist has instead looked for objects that resonate with specific qualities in his own practice: the perverse pull of the repellent, the erotic and poetic allure of the fragment, and masquerade as the artifice that allows for the dissolution of boundaries between self and other, life and death. Toward this end, UklaÅski included three examples of his own work in addition to those shown in the survey in the Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography ( gallery 851 )."
2015,Bazm and Razm,"February 17–May 31, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/bazm-and-razm,"For centuries, Persian kingship was epitomized by two complementary pursuits: bazm (feast) and razm (fight). The ruler's success as both a reveler and hunter/warrior distinguished him as a worthy and legitimate sovereign. The pairing of bazm and razm as the ultimate royal activities is an ancient concept with roots in pre-Islamic Iran. It is a recurring theme in the Shahnama (or Book of Kings)—the Persian national epic—as well as other poetic and historic texts. This exhibition features some three dozen works of art in various media, created between the fifteenth century and the present day. Works from the Museum's Department of Islamic Art that illustrate the linked nature of bazm and razm are displayed alongside corresponding works—primarily Persian—from the departments of Asian Art , Arms and Armor , and Musical Instruments . The exhibition charts the gradual shift in meaning and usage of this pairing as it emerged from a strictly royal, or princely, context and became more widespread.

2015,Captain Linnaeus Tripe,"February 24–May 25, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/linnaeus-tripe,"This is the first major traveling exhibition devoted to the British photographer Captain Linnaeus Tripe (1822–1902). Between 1854 and 1860, Tripe produced an unprecedented series of photographs documenting the landscape and cultural artifacts of south India and Burma (now the Republic of Myanmar). With few models to follow, he developed a professional practice under the auspices of the British East India Company, the commercial enterprise governing the region as Great Britain's imperial agent. As an officer in the British army, he traveled with diplomatic expeditions, creating a visual inventory of celebrated archaeological sites and monuments, religious and secular buildings—some now destroyed—as well as geological formations and scenic vistas. His training as a military surveyor, where the choice of viewpoint and careful attention to visual details were essential, gave his photographs a striking aesthetic rigor that distinguishes them from the picturesque travel views characteristic of the period. This exhibition of approximately sixty photographs traces Tripe's work from his earliest images made in England (1852–1854), to those created on expeditions to the south Indian kingdom of Mysore (1854), to Burma (1855), and again to south India (1857–1858). Using large-format wax paper negatives, he achieved remarkably consistent results despite the south Asian heat and humidity, which posed constant challenges to photographic chemistry. The comprehensive scope of his work offered its British audience a virtual tour through a foreign landscape, rendering it knowable and preserving sites already bearing traces of colonial rule. The exhibition is made possible by The Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation. It was organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, London."

2015,Selections from the Collection of Jefferson R. Burdick,"October 6, 2014–April 9, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/burdick-collection-october-rotation,"The Burdick Baseball Card collection constitutes an integral part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of ephemera and tells the history of popular printmaking in the United States. In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of approximately thirty thousand baseball cards in large batches, along with another 270,000 trade and postcards, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1959 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century into the golden age and modern era of the sport. The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."
2015,Painting Music in the Age of Caravaggio,"January 20–April 5, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/painting-music-age-of-caravaggio,"This exhibition poses the question, What did people ""hear"" when they looked at paintings of musical performances by Caravaggio and his contemporaries? There is no doubt that these pictures had an intentionally aural, as well as visual, component: silent music is their theme. The period during which the three paintings on view in the exhibition—Caravaggio's The Musicians , Valentin de Boulogne's The Lute Player , and Laurent de La Hyre's Allegory of Music —were created witnessed the birth of opera and the promotion of the solo voice performed by professional singers rather than amateurs. It also witnessed the creation of new instruments that challenged the primacy of the lute. The exhibition pairs the three paintings with musical instruments similar to those depicted, and an audio component allows visitors to hear music played on them."
2015,The Art of the Chinese Album,"September 6, 2014–March 29, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/art-of-the-chinese-album,"This exhibition showcases the album, one of the most intimate of Chinese painting formats. The special structure of the album, in which each turn of the page is an opportunity to remake the world anew, presents unique possibilities and challenges for artists. For Dai Benxiao (1621–1693), the album was a chance to plumb the depths of a single style, like a jazz improviser testing the limits of a single musical mode. For Shitao (1642–1707), the album provided the opportunity to shock and surprise the viewer with radical shifts in perspective and subject from page to page. For Dong Qichang (1555–1636) and his followers, the album was a stage on which to display their art historical knowledge by devoting each leaf to the style of a different old master. This exhibition explores these and other ways that artists have used this format from the twelfth century to the present. Featured Media The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

Lent by the Shanghai Museum, these wine vessels—a pair of pear-shaped containers and a unique four-legged vessel in the form of a fantastic buffalo—exemplify the artistic sophistication and technical virtuosity of the Houma foundry, a major center of bronze casting in the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 b.c. ). The bronzes are accompanied by two ceramic mold fragments, illustrating how the bronzes' intricate surface décor was achieved, and by a small number of related bronzes from the Metropolitan's collection."
2015,Paper Chase,"December 9, 2014–March 16, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/paper-chase,"This exhibition of works of art on paper pays tribute to the esteemed connoisseur and brilliant curator George R. Goldner, Drue Heinz Chairman of the Department of Drawings and Prints since 1993, who will be stepping down in early 2015. Under Goldner's leadership, the Department of Drawings and Prints has acquired—through purchases, gifts, and bequests—some 8,200 works on paper from Europe and the Americas dating from about 1370 to the present. These acquisitions range from famous works such as Leonardo da Vinci's studies for a statue of Hercules to those more esoteric such as Hans Christian Andersen's A Whole Cut Fairy Tale . There are rare works such as the subtle engraving The Queen of Flowers by the Master of the Playing Cards and exceptional examples of an artist's oeuvre such as the majestic drawing Queen Esther Approaching the Palace of Ahasuerus by Claude Lorrain. Upon joining the Metropolitan, Goldner set out to strengthen our extensive holdings of drawings and prints so that all important periods and schools were well represented. He undertook this mission with passion, instinct, and a shrewd knowledge of the art market, acquiring Netherlandish, German, British, and French drawings from collections, dealers, and auctions around the world. Goldner made remarkable discoveries, among them his first purchase for the Metropolitan—an exquisite landscape drawing by Pietro Perugino. Superb works by Titian ( 1999.28 ), Peter Paul Rubens ( 2000.483 ), William Blake ( 2011.448 ), and Paul Gauguin ( 1996.418 ) have also entered the collection under his stewardship.

2015,Madame Cézanne,"November 19, 2014–March 15, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/madame-cezanne,"This exhibition of paintings, drawings, and watercolors by Paul Cézanne (French, 1839–1906) traces his lifelong attachment to Hortense Fiquet (French, 1850–1922), his wife, the mother of his only son, and his most-painted model. Featuring twenty-five of the artist's twenty-nine known portraits of Hortense, including Madame Cézanne in the Conservatory (1891) and Madame Cézanne in a Red Dress (1888–90), both from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, the exhibition explores the profound impact she had on Cézanne's portrait practice. The works on view were painted over a period of more than twenty years, but despite this long liaison, Hortense Fiquet's prevailing presence is often disregarded and frequently diminished in the narrative of Cézanne's life and work. Her expression in the painted portraits has been variously described as remote, inscrutable, dismissive, and even surly. And yet the portraits are at once alluring and confounding, recording a complex working dialogue that this unprecedented exhibition and accompanying publication explore on many levels. The depictions of Hortense in oil, watercolor, and graphite provide the only material clues to her partnership with Cézanne, which began in Paris in 1869, while she was working as a bookbinder. Although the circumstances of their first encounter are unknown, an early portrait from 1872 suggests that she was modeling for Cézanne by the age of twenty-two. Cézanne took great pains to conceal his mistress and their only child, Paul, from his family, fearing his authoritative father's disapproval. This complicated subterfuge led to separate residences, frequent and often desperate appeals for funds, and long periods of living apart, even after their marriage in 1886. Despite this seeming neglect, the portraits attest to the constancy of a relationship that was critical to the artist's practice and development. Their story is a compelling one indeed, perhaps all the more so for the absence of its particulars. Read blog posts related to this exhibition on Met Blogs. Featured Media ""Superb...

2015,Colors of the Universe,"December 11, 2013–March 9, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2013/chinese-carving,"Stone carving is one of the oldest arts in China, its beginnings dating back to remote antiquity. Although jade, the mineral nephrite, was held in the highest esteem, all stones that could achieve a luster after polishing, be it agate, turquoise, malachite, chalcedony, quartz, jasper, or lapis lazuli, were also appreciated. Stone carving experienced an efflorescence during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), when an abundant supply of raw materials, exceptionally accomplished craftsmen, and, in particular, keen imperial patronage contributed to the creation of numerous superb works. The stone carvings of the Qing period can be grouped in three categories: personal adornments such as rings, bracelets, and pendants; articles for daily use (mainly in the scholar's studio) such as brush holders, water pots, and seals; and display pieces such as copies of antiques, miniature mountains, and animal and human figures, the latter being the largest of the group. The carvings can also be classified by their decorative style: archaic or classical, meaning their shapes were derived from ancient ritual vessels; ""Western,"" which bore the influence of contemporary Mughal art from northern India; and new or modern, meaning novel shapes and designs created during the Qing dynasty. A common decorative theme, especially among works of the new style, was the use of rebuses, which are symbols associated with auspicious meanings, to convey wishes for prosperity, longevity, good fortune, perpetuation of a family line, or academic success. The tradition began early but remained largely in the popular culture until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when significant social changes and increased imperial patronage helped elevate the rebus to the high art of the court."
2015,The Winchester Bible,"December 9, 2014–March 9, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/winchester-bible,"This exhibition features masterfully illuminated pages from two volumes of the magnificent, lavishly ornamented Winchester Bible. Probably commissioned around 1150 by the wealthy and powerful Henry of Blois (about 1098–1171), who was the bishop of Winchester (and grandson of William the Conqueror and King Stephen's brother), the manuscript is the Winchester Cathedral's single greatest surviving treasure. Renovations at the Cathedral provide the opportunity for these pages, which feature the Old Testament, to travel to New York. This presentation marks the first time the work will be shown in the United States. At the Metropolitan Museum, the pages of one bound volume will be turned once each month; three unbound bi-folios with lavish initials from the other volume—which is currently undergoing conservation—will be on view simultaneously for the duration of the exhibition. A highlight of the presentation is the display of an elaborately illustrated double-sided frontispiece—long separated from the Bible and now in the collection of the Morgan Library & Museum in New York—that features scenes from the life of David and Samuel. Works of art from the Metropolitan Museum's own collection—medieval sculpture, goldsmith work, ivories, stained glass, and other examples of manuscript illumination—provide a larger context for the two volumes. The Winchester Bible consists of four bound volumes whose pages measure approximately 23 inches high by 15 inches wide (58 by 39 centimeters). The text of 468 folios was written over a period of thirty years by a single scribe with at least six different gifted painters applying expensive pigments, including lapis lazuli and gold, to calf-skin parchment. Their ambitious work was never completed. Featured Media The exhibition is made possible by the Michel David-Weill Fund. The Winchester Bible has been lent by The Chapter of Winchester Cathedral."

2015,Carleton Watkins: Yosemite,"November 3, 2014–February 1, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/carleton-watkins,"Carleton Watkins (1829–1916) was the consummate photographer of the American West. Born in Oneonta, New York, he moved to California in 1849, taught himself the new medium of photography, and established his reputation in 1861 with an astonishing series of views of Yosemite Valley. It was partly due to the artistry and rugged beauty of these photographs that President Lincoln signed a bill on June 30, 1864, declaring the valley inviolate and initiating the blueprint for the nation's National Park System. In the middle of the brutal Civil War and its destruction of man and land, Lincoln saw the preservation of a small but extraordinary piece of America's wilderness as a progressive goal to share with the republic. Watkins was a virtuoso practitioner of the difficult wet-collodion process, and the remarkable clarity of his ""mammoth"" prints (18 by 22 inches) was unmatched. He rendered with exquisite finesse the vastness and grandeur of Yosemite's glacial valleys, dramatic waterfalls, massive rock faces, and majestic trees. Watkins produced this work wrangling a dozen or more mules carrying roughly two thousand pounds of equipment, including his oversize camera, large glass plates, and flammable chemicals. It is in itself a miracle that any photographs survived these travails. The exhibition includes a suite of views made by Watkins during his first encounter with the sublime topography of Yosemite in 1861 as well as a larger group of studies from his later visits to the valley in 1865 and 1866 while working for the California State Geological Survey. It features thirty-six photographs that helped advance the notion that Yosemite was a Pacific paradise, a bit of Eden in North America. The exhibition is made possible by Jennifer S. and Philip F. Maritz and an anonymous donor."

Approximately thirty ensembles, many of which are being exhibited for the first time, reveal the impact of high-fashion standards on the sartorial dictates of bereavement rituals as they evolved over a century. The thematic exhibition is organized chronologically and features mourning dress from 1815 to 1915, primarily from The Costume Institute's collection, including mourning gowns worn by Queen Victoria and Queen Alexandra. The calendar of bereavement's evolution and cultural implications is illuminated through women's clothing and accessories, showing the progression of appropriate fabrics from mourning crape to corded silks, and the later introduction of color with shades of gray and mauve. The Anna Wintour Costume Center's Carl and Iris Barrel Apfel Gallery orients visitors to the exhibition with fashion plates, jewelry, and accessories. The main Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery illustrates the evolution of mourning wear through high-fashion silhouettes.

Translated literally as ""thing to wear,"" the kimono has gone through major transformations throughout history: in the Edo period (1615–1868) it was an everyday garment, and now it is worn mainly on special occasions and collected as ""traditional Japanese art."" Its design, function, and meaning have shifted dramatically in the last one hundred and fifty years, shaped by the dialogue of Japanese traditions, modern inventions, and Western ideas. Featuring more than fifty spectacular robes, this exhibition tells a story about the Japanese garment whose designs mirror trends in pictorial and decorative arts of every era. Both sumptuous garments custom-made for wealthy patrons and everyday wear available for sale to the general public are represented. Highlights also include three examples of contemporary kimono created by designers designated by the Japanese government as Living National Treasures. Some twenty-five robes on loan from private and public collections, including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the John C. Weber Collection, Julia Meech Collection, and others complement examples from the Metropolitan's Asian Art and Costume Institute collections; they are exhibited together with paintings, prints, and illustrated books, as well as lacquerware and ceramics, that share common design patterns with kimono.

This exhibition documents the interdependent, mutually transformative relationship between player and instrument through a presentation of nearly forty rare instruments and works of art from the Elahi collection, the Musée de la Musique, Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum. It includes rare tanbÅ«rs that belonged to Ostad Elahi and his father, who was also a great tanbÅ«r player; a number of Ostad's personal possessions, such as his judicial robes and a selection of manuscripts; as well as symbolic items that provide greater insights into his disciplined approach to life. Long-necked, plucked stringed instruments have been used in central and western Asia since the third millennium b.c. They appeared first in Mesopotamia and later in Egypt, and in their long history have been used for both secular and sacred music from Egypt and Greece to central and western Asia and India. The tanbÅ«r became a sacred, venerated instrument used by the Kurdish Ahl-e Haqq (""fervents of truth"") order, founded in the late fourteenth century. The members of the order are primarily from western Iran and Iraq and use the instrument for contemplation, meditation, and ecstatic dance. Nour Ali Elahi, later known as Ostad (master) Elahi, was raised in western Iran and learned tanbÅ«r from his father, Hadj Nematollah, a charismatic mystic and poet who attracted musicians from as far as Turkey and India. As a young child, because his hands were so small, Ostad played a tanbÅ«r built from a wooden ladle, eventually graduating to the larger instrument. Under his father's tutelage and influenced by the players who came to hear his father's teaching, Ostad rapidly absorbed multiple musical styles and playing techniques, becoming a consummate master of the tanbÅ«r by the age of nine.

2015,Amie Siegel:Provenance,"June 23, 2014–January 4, 2015",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/amie-siegel,"For the past decade and a half, Amie Siegel (American, born 1974) has worked between film, installation, photography, and performance, questioning the tropes of cinematic forms. Siegel's three-part installation, Provenance , will be shown in its entirety for the first time at the Metropolitan Museum. Provenance is a touchstone in Siegel's work, with its accumulative, cinematic representation of economic and political cycles. The work enacts a slow reveal over multiple parts, stripping back the layers of patrimony that influence the cultural value of objects to ask a broad set of contemporary questions about the speculative markets of art and design. Provenance focuses on an emblem of mid-century modernist design—the furniture designed by the Swiss architect Pierre Jeanneret for the buildings of Chandigarh, the controversial modernist city in India. Beginning with the furniture's present circumstances as decoration in wealthy homes, the work then traces the furniture's journey in reverse chronology through warehouses, on display at American and European auctions, at a furniture restorer's, on a cargo ship, and, finally, back to their origins in Chandigarh. In their original context, these prized pieces function as everyday office furniture. Their migration as the spoils of modern design discloses the gulf between disparate settings, mapping the undercurrents of larger movements of capital.

As Assyria expanded, the Phoenician city-states of the Levant—precariously located along the edge of Assyrian territory—were compelled to expand and strengthen their maritime trade networks to the west. The mercantile connections they established along the northern coast of Africa and the southern coast of Europe to the Strait of Gibraltar and beyond, to the Atlantic, became conduits for raw materials, luxury goods, images, and ideas between the Near East and the Mediterranean. This landmark exhibition traces—through some 260 works of art on loan from major collections in Western Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East, North Africa, and the United States—the deep roots of interaction between the ancient Near East and the lands along the shores of the Mediterranean and their impact on the artistic traditions that developed in the region. Parallels are also drawn between works in the exhibition and those in the Metropolitan Museum's permanent collection of ancient Near Eastern art.

2016,Sol LeWitt:Wall Drawing #370,"June 30, 2014–January 28, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/sol-lewitt,"Sol LeWitt (American, 1928–2007) executed drawings by hand throughout his life; in 1968 he extricated his work from the confines of the frame and transferred it directly to the wall. The wall compositions were designed for limited duration and maximum flexibility within a broad range of architectural settings. Initially executed by drafters, these works in their finished state were most often slated for destruction. A seminal practitioner of Conceptual Art, LeWitt emphasized the creative idea that generates a work of art, as opposed to the work's material existence. ""For each work of art that becomes physical,"" he wrote, ""there are many variations that do not."" Sol LeWitt's 1982 Wall Drawing #370: Ten Geometric Figures (including right triangle, cross, X, diamond) with three-inch parallel bands of lines in two directions was installed at the Museum over a period of four weeks. The drawing will be on view in its complete state through January 28, 2018, when it will be painted over. The loan of Wall Drawing #370 is courtesy of The Estate of Sol LeWitt.

2016,The Aesthetic Movement in America,"July 13, 2016–December 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/aesthetic-movement,"This installation highlights a great strength of The Met collection—arts of the late 19th-century Anglo-American Aesthetic movement. Featuring a range of art furniture, ceramics, stained glass, metalwork, textiles, painting, and sculpture—most from the Museum's permanent holdings and a few select loans—the display explores Aestheticism as a cultural phenomenon of its time that promoted beauty as an artistic, social, and moral force, particularly in the domestic realm. The catalyst for the phenomenon's widespread popularity in the United States was the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition, held in Philadelphia, and Aestheticism remained a driving force through the late 1880s, especially in New York. The period witnessed the flourishing of an artistic culture and lifestyle movement that also encompassed painting, sculpture, and works on paper; the proliferation of art publications, clubs, and societies; an intense interest in collecting and decoration; and the founding of the nation's major art museums. Aesthetic furnishings and objects were intended for fully integrated domestic spaces—as seen, for example, in The Met's latest historical interior, the Worsham-Rockefeller Dressing Room, on view nearby—and reveal the progressive tastes and collaborative spirit of the era."
2016,Arms and Armor from the Islamic World,"February 10, 2016–December 3, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/arms-and-armor-islamic-world,"This exhibition features a selection of more than three dozen historical examples of Islamic arms and armor, which represent the breadth and depth of The Met's renowned holdings in this area. Focusing primarily on the courts of the Mamluk and Ottoman sultans, shahs of Iran, and Mughal emperors of India, the exhibition celebrates the publication of Islamic Arms and Armor in The Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Museum's first scholarly volume on the subject. Highlights of the installation include a magnificent Ottoman helmet embellished with pious Qur'anic verses in gold and a luxurious gold-encrusted saber bearing inscriptions praising King Solomon (Süleyman)—both from the time of Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent (r. 1520–66); the earliest documented Islamic sword, a ninth-century example discovered in 1939 in the Museum's excavations at Nishapur, Iran; and a dagger covered with a mosaic of rubies and emeralds made in the court workshops of the Mughal emperor Jahangir (r. 1605–27). Also on view are several works that have not been exhibited for decades. #IslamicArmsandArmor The publication is made possible by the Grancsay Fund and The Jessica E. Smith and Kevin R.

The exhibition offers stellar examples of Korean art in areas not often represented in American collections as well as treasured highlights from The Met collection. Organized chronologically from the Late Bronze Age to the 21st century, the exhibition conveys the broad framework of Korean art history. Among the objects reflecting key genres and themes of Korean art are strikingly modern-looking pots and glittering jewelry from ancient burial sites; exquisite gilded Buddhist sculpture from the seventh through the seventeenth century; sophisticated celadon and metalwork of the Goryeo dynasty; porcelain with delightful and distinctively Korean designs; and paintings on diverse subjects from the Joseon and early modern periods. #MetKoreanArt The exhibition is made possible in part by The Met's collaboration with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of the Republic of Korea and the National Museum of Korea."
2016,Colors of the Universe: Chinese Hardstone Carvings,"June 25, 2016–October 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/colors-of-the-universe,"Hardstone carving is one of the oldest arts in China, dating back to the fifth millennium B.C. It was not until the Qing dynasty, however, that an abundant supply of raw material, extraordinary craftsmanship, and keen imperial patronage allowed the art to flourish. During the 18th century, widespread prosperity and successful military campaigns brought political stability, while also securing the trade routes that permitted the importation of gemstones over the Silk Roads and through sea trade routes from as far away as Europe. Showcasing a selection of 75 exquisite carvings drawn from The Met collection, this exhibition presents the lapidary art of China's Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Featuring not only jade, the most esteemed of East Asian gems, but also agate, malachite, turquoise, quartz, amber, coral, and lapis lazuli, the exhibition reveals the extensive variety of hardstones and full palette of vibrant colors that were favored at the imperial court. Exploring the diverse subjects and styles of Qing lapidary art, Colors of the Universe illustrates the extraordinary imagination and technical virtuosity behind these miniature sculptures. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2016,From the Imperial Theater,"June 25, 2016–October 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/from-the-imperial-theater,"Drawn entirely from The Met collection, this exhibition examines these luxury textiles from artistic and technical points of view. It is organized in two rotations: The first focuses on costumes used in dramas based on historical events; and the second features costumes from plays derived from legends and myths. The presentation showcases eight robes, each of which was created for a specific role—court lady, official, general, monk, nun, and immortal. A set of album leaves faithfully depicting theatrical characters wearing such robes is also displayed. The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed a flowering of Chinese drama. Under the patronage of the Qing court (1644–1911), performances—including the ""Peking Opera""—filled the Forbidden City in Beijing. A form of traditional Chinese theater, Peking Opera was developed fully by the mid-19th century, and because of the form's minimal stage settings and the importance of exaggerated gestures and movements, costume played an unusually significant role. This exhibition includes superb examples with interior markings indicating their use in court productions. #ChineseOperaCostumes The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2016,Cinnabar,"June 25, 2016–October 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/cinnabar,"This exhibition, featuring 45 magnificent examples of Chinese carved lacquer drawn entirely from The Met collection, will explore the development of this significant artistic tradition. Among the objects on view will be works created as birthday gifts bearing symbols of long life, such as peaches, cranes, the character for longevity (shou), and representations of children. One of the highlights is a unique, large, lobed tray of the 14th century, carved with a delightful scene showing two women and 33 children. Other early pieces on view include a dish with a scene of long-tailed birds and hollyhocks. A rare screen that was produced by Lu Guisheng—a famous 19th-century artist and one of the few individuals working in lacquer whose name is recorded in Chinese history—provides a spectacular finale to this tradition. Lacquer, the resin of a family of trees found in southern China, hardens when exposed to oxygen and humidity and can become a natural plastic. Tinted with cinnabar (red), carbon (black), and other minerals, it has been used as an artistic medium in China since at least the sixth century B.C. Carved lacquer, which involves applying multiple layers of lacquer onto a substructure (usually wood) and then entails carving through the layers, is the most laborious and time-consuming of all lacquering techniques. #ChineseLacquer The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2016,Late Antique Textiles and Modern Design,"November 11, 2016–October 1, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/late-antique-textiles-and-modern-design,"Artists and designers often look to the past to find inspiration for their own work. This exhibition—drawn entirely from The Met collection—compares foliate patterns and roundels that are found on textiles from the Late Roman, Byzantine, and Early Islamic periods in Egypt to similar motifs in postcards by the Wiener Werkstätte and on garments designed by Mariano Fortuny (1871–1949). Created in Egypt between about 200 and 600, the textiles on view include a child's dress; fragments from a sleeve, tunic, and blanket or cover; and other fragments whose original use is not known. Variations of the scrolling vines and stylized motifs that adorn these textiles can be seen on works created nearly 1500 years later. The renowned Spanish-born designer Mariano Fortuny was active in Venice, where he founded a textile workshop and commercial silk printing factory. His exquisite designs fuse the ancient and the modern, the local and the exotic. Three different Fortuny-designed silk coats from the first three decades of the 20th century are shown over the course of the exhibition. In cut and ornament, these items harken back to Late Antique historical sources. Founded in 1903 in reaction both to the neoclassical academies of Vienna and increasing industrialization, the Wiener Werkstätte collective sought to incorporate arts and crafts into all aspects of daily life and placed a premium on the handmade. Eight color lithographs created between 1907 and 1912 by various artists and designers affiliated with the group are also on view. Motifs similar to those found on Late Antique textiles were used as graphic elements in these cards and postcards."
2016,Collecting the Arts of Mexico,"July 17, 2015–September 4, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/collecting-the-arts-of-mexico,"In 1911, Emily Johnston de Forest gave her collection of pottery from Mexico to The Met. Calling it ""Mexican maiolica,"" she highlighted its importance as a North American artistic achievement. De Forest was the daughter of the Museum's first president and, with her husband, Robert, a founder of The American Wing. The De Forests envisioned building a collection of Mexican art, and, even though their ambitions were frustrated at the time, the foundational gift of more than one hundred pieces of pottery anchors The Met's holdings. Today, more than a century later, their vision resonates as the Museum commits to collecting and exhibiting not just the arts of Mexico, but all of Latin America. This exhibition highlights the early contributions of the De Forests and others, and presents recent additions to the collection for the first time."
2016,Simple Gifts: Shaker at The Met,"July 13, 2016–August 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/simple-gifts,"The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing—also known as the Shakers—is a utopian religious sect that rose to prominence in America in the 19th century. The Shakers distinguished themselves from mainstream American culture by establishing communities centered on the equality of the sexes, collective property, pacifism, and industry. This installation features more than two dozen works from The Met's permanent collection, including furniture, textiles, and tools, that reflect the Shakers' life and art. These objects embody the Shakers' characteristic, minimalist designs and careful craftsmanship, both of which strongly influenced 19th-century counterparts in the external world as well as 20th- and 21st-century modern artists, performers, collectors, and museums. From the 1930s to '60s, collectors Faith and Edward Andrews cultivated relationships with surviving Shaker groups in New York and New England and accumulated the most comprehensive collection of furniture, textiles, and archival objects from the Believers. In 1966, The Met acquired numerous works from the Andrewses' collection, several of which are on view in this installation. In addition, Shaker artifacts are grouped near paintings by artist Charles Sheeler (1883–1965) and a video projection of Martha Graham's modern dance Appalachian Spring , which was performed on a stage set designed by Isamu Noguchi and choreographed to Aaron Copland's timeless musical score. The blending of historic and modern artwork in this installation provides a compelling narrative on the legacy of Shaker design from the 19th through the 21st century."
2016,Show and Tell,"October 29, 2016–August 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/show-and-tell,"In China, paintings that tell stories serve as powerful vehicles to promote political agendas, endorse cultural values, or express personal thoughts. With masterpieces dating from the fourth century, narrative is the earliest established genre in Chinese painting. This exhibition is the first at The Met to explore the various ways in which Chinese artists have gone beyond mere illustration to convey multiple layers of meaning. Displaying works from the 12th century to the present, this exhibition introduces three distinct modes of pictorial storytelling: multipart illustrations presented in long handscrolls, often punctuated with passages of text; single iconic scenes that evoke an entire story; and generic landscapes or flower-and-bird paintings that acquire narrative significance through the artist's inscription. The exhibition is further organized by theme: historical events, seasonal progression, warfare, journeys, Buddhist and Confucian values, and family and friendship. One special gallery focuses on a grandiose military narrative—that of China's annexation of East Turkestan in the 1750s. The installation, a collaboration among three Museum departments, features a suite of European engravings alongside Chinese weaponry and a painting to show how an emperor exploited art for his own aggrandizement. Contemporary Chinese artists have continued the narrative tradition with an expanded repertoire of subjects and approaches. The examples on display range from reflections on the creative process to critiques of modern technology and government policies. Together, the approximately 60 pictorial works and 30 decorative art objects, most from The Met collection, present a comprehensive view of the narrative genre, demonstrating its expressive versatility and continuing relevance. #ChinesePainting  The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2016,Asian Art at 100: A History in Photographs,"September 5, 2015–August 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/asian-art-history-in-photographs,"Since The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870, the institution's physical space and collection have grown and its curatorial departments have diversified. The first Asian works of art to enter the collection—mostly ceramics and lacquers—were acquired in 1879 and originally accommodated in what was then called the Department of Decorative Arts. Only in 1915 was a separate Department of Far Eastern Art established, and it was not until 1986 that its name was changed to the Department of Asian Art. The timeline presented in the photographs in this exhibition chronicles the changing face of The Met's galleries of Asian art as the building's footprint has expanded, exhibition styles have evolved, and the collection has grown. Forever a work in progress, The Met's collection of Asian art is ultimately the product of the passion and scholarship of the many collectors, curators, donors, dealers, and directors who have together shaped the Museum's holdings and legacy. #AsianArt100"
2016,Renaissance Maiolica,"October 20, 2016–July 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/renaissance-maiolica,"This exhibition of Renaissance maiolica, drawn exclusively from The Met's world-renowned collection, celebrates the publication of Maiolica, Italian Renaissance Ceramics in The Metropolitan Museum of Art by Timothy Wilson. As Wilson writes, ""Painted pottery, at its most ambitious, is a serious form of Italian Renaissance art, with much to offer those interested in the wider culture of this astoundingly creative period."" This creativity was applied to a vast range of practical objects. The exhibition includes tableware and serving vessels, desk ornaments, storage containers, devotional objects, as well as sculpture, all made in painted and tin-glazed earthenware. The maiolica tradition flourished from the 15th to the 17th century. Italian potters transformed techniques they owed to the Islamic world into something entirely unprecedented, and in turn laid the foundations for similar pottery traditions across Europe. Potters and pottery painters exploited innovations of the Renaissance goldsmith, sculptor, and painter in what was a relatively humble medium. That it was owned by the social elite of Italy, however, testifies to its artistic value. This exhibition explores how the different functions of Renaissance maiolica dictated the ways painted pottery was seen and decorated. Groups of objects are installed in displays suggestive of their use. An assembly of storage jars give a sense of a pharmacy's shelves. Among the tableware on display are istoriato plates and dishes—their surfaces covered with scenes from mythology and ancient history—from some of the most important services commissioned by leading Italian families. The exhibition also shows maiolica-makers using ceramic, paint, and glaze to compete with other art forms, including a Madonna and Child that imitates a framed panel painting and a Lamentation group that likely once functioned as a sculpted altarpiece, the largest known example of sculptural maiolica to survive. The publication is made possible by The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Friends of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, The Peter Jay Sharp Foundation, Marica and Jan Vilcek, and Ceramica-Stiftung Basel."

Chappel (1801–1878), a tinsmith and amateur painter, depicted scenes of early 19th-century New York City. This exhibition features 27 small oil paintings from The Met collection that were probably executed late in the artist's life. Chappel's meticulously detailed images of street peddlers, artisan workshops, and swimmers cooling off in the East River—the kinds of commonplace scenes that were seldom documented—provide a rare glimpse of urban life 200 years ago.

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of over 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1962 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the 19th century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

The selection features approximately 30 medals from Italy and Northern Europe, including early bronze examples by Pisanello, the celebrated artist who invented this art form in the mid-15th century, as well as rare wax models dating to the 17th century. Works of technical and stylistic virtuosity, the medals combine poignant portraits of contemporary rulers, dignitaries, and literary figures on one side, and rich, symbolic imagery on the other. The commemorative medal epitomized seminal cultural values of the Renaissance period, namely, the emphasis on the primacy of the individual and the revival of classical antiquity. The exhibition, which explores the development and role of the portrait medal in Renaissance culture, as well as production techniques, celebrates the recently published catalogue of the Lehman Collection's holdings of European sculpture and metalwork."

The exhibition opens with works from the late 1960s and early 1970s by artists in America and Europe who brought the lessons of Minimal and Conceptual art to bear on views of nature both raw and acculturated. Also included are a series of unique Polaroid prints made by Walker Evans in Hale County—the setting for his famous 1930s photographs of Alabama sharecroppers—near the end of his life. Images from the 1980s and 1990s attest to a swing away from the ""deskilling"" associated with radical '60s art making and toward a new interest in technically assured large-scale prints that nevertheless incorporated earlier lessons from Land art, Conceptualism, and other postwar avant-garde movements. The exhibition concludes with recently made works—including Wolfgang Staehle's mesmerizing piece Eastpoint (September 15, 2004) (2004–6), which projects a 24-hour cycle of more than 8,000 still images, synchronized to real time, of the same Hudson River that inspired such American painters as Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church. #PoeticsofPlace"

Working together, Hayter and Reddy made groundbreaking advances in simultaneous color printing, known as the viscosity method. After learning intaglio at Atelier 17, Hashmi added Japanese woodblock to her repertoire. The collaborative exchanges fostered at Atelier 17 remain important sources of inspiration for both Hashmi and Reddy, who have lived in New York City since the 1970s.

""In New York? But there are no churches . . . no monuments."" ""There's the Art Museum—in the Park,"" he explained. . . . [And the next day, upon meeting:] ""It's odd,"" Madame Olenska said, ""I never came here before."" ""Ah, well—. Some day, I suppose, it will be a great Museum."" ""Yes,"" she assented absently. —Edith Wharton, The Age of Innocence (1920) Ever since its foundational acquisition of 174 Old Master paintings in 1871—the very time frame for Edith Wharton's acclaimed novel—The Met has aimed to become that ""great museum"" Newland Archer imagined. Thanks to generous donations and bequests, as well as purchases, the collection of European paintings has grown into one of the finest in the world. But this does not mean it is static or complete. Our understanding of the past is in a constant state of revision, and curators must always be on the lookout for works of art that reshape the stories we tell, sometimes in subtle and other times in striking ways. The department's most important acquisition of the past few years is unquestionably the monumental portrait of the family of the great banker-collector Everhard Jabach by Charles Le Brun—one of the landmarks of French 17th-century painting (on view in gallery 617 ). Each painting presented in this exhibition enlarges in a significant fashion the narrative we attempt to relate under the roof of this now great museum."

2016,Max Beckmann in New York,"October 19, 2016–February 20, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/max-beckmann,"This exhibition puts a spotlight on artist Max Beckmann's special connection with New York City, featuring 14 paintings that he created while living in New York from 1949 to 1950, as well as 25 earlier works from New York collections. The exhibition assembles several groups of iconic works, including self-portraits; mythical, expressionist interiors; robust, colorful portraits of women and performers; landscapes; and triptychs. During the late 1920s, Max Beckmann (1884–1950) was at the pinnacle of his career in Germany; his work was presented by prestigious art dealers, he taught at the Städel Art School in Frankfurt, and he moved in a circle of influential writers, critics, publishers, and collectors. After the National Socialists labeled his works ""degenerate"" and confiscated them from German museums in 1937, Beckmann left the country and immigrated to Holland, where he remained for 10 years. In 1947, he accepted a temporary teaching position in St. Louis, Missouri, and in September 1949, he moved to New York City, which he described as ""a prewar Berlin multiplied a hundredfold."" Life in Manhattan energized him and resulted in such powerful pictures as Falling Man (1950) and The Town (City Night) (1950). In late December 1950, Beckmann set out from his apartment on the Upper West Side of New York to see his Self-Portrait in Blue Jacket (1950), which was on view at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in the exhibition American Painting Today . However, on the corner of 69th Street and Central Park West, the 66-year-old artist suffered a fatal heart attack and never made it to the Museum. The poignant circumstance of the artist's death served as the inspiration for this exhibition. #MaxBeckmann The exhibition is made possible by The Isaacson-Draper Foundation.

During the seven decades since The Costume Institute became part of The Met in 1946, that collecting strategy has shifted from creating a collection of Western high fashion that is encyclopedic in breadth to one focused on acquiring masterworks. The exhibition, in the Anna Wintour Costume Center, highlights approximately 60 of these masterworks from the early 18th century to the present. The Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery is organized chronologically with ensembles shown on platforms resembling oversized packing crates. Each object—primarily women's wear, as well as some men's wear ensembles and a selection of accessories—is accompanied by an in-depth explanation of its significance within the canon of fashion history.

Hoping to verify religious faith through the objective documentation of the city's holy sites, he turned to photography, creating one of the most enigmatic bodies of work of the 19th century. Despite a high-caliber photographic oeuvre of great variation and creativity, Salzmann remains relatively unknown. Some three dozen rare salted paper prints from paper negatives have been selected from his influential 1856 album, Jerusalem: A Study and Photographic Reproduction of the Monuments of the Holy City .

Because of their sensitivity to light, these works cannot be on permanent exhibition; each installation remains on view for approximately 13 weeks. The rotations of the gallery consist of diverse pieces—new acquisitions as well as works that might not find their way into a major exhibition. They are selected to show the breadth and quality of the Museum's holdings, ranging from the Renaissance to the present. Highlights from this rotation include Old Master and modern works that engage the theme of repetition, including drawings by Italian artists Annibale Carracci (1560–1609), Mauro Gandolfi (1764–1834), and Carlo Maratti (1625–1713); prints by American artists Anders Bergstrom (born 1971), Roy Lichtenstein (1923–1997), Barnett Newman (1905–1970), Henry Pearson (1914–2006), and Susan Schwalb (born 1944), as well as Swiss artists Pierrette Bloch (born 1928) and Dieter Roth (1930–1998); drawings and prints from the 17th through the 19th century showcasing artists' interpretations of Jerusalem through the lens of history, religion, and mythology; a selection of drawings by Fra Bartolomeo (1473–1517) that explores the broad range of the artist's style and technique as a draftsman on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of his death; and posters, postcards, and photographs that focus on the burgeoning state of California in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
2016,Kerry James Marshall: Mastry,"October 25, 2016–January 29, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/kerry-james-marshall,"This major monographic exhibition is the largest museum retrospective to date of the work of American artist Kerry James Marshall (born 1955). Encompassing nearly 80 works—including 72 paintings—that span the artist's remarkable 35-year career, it reveals Marshall's practice to be one that synthesizes a wide range of pictorial traditions to counter stereotypical representations of black people in society and reassert the place of the black figure within the canon of Western painting. Born before the passage of the Civil Rights Act in Birmingham, Alabama, and witness to the Watts rebellion in 1965, Marshall has long been an inspired and imaginative chronicler of the African American experience. He is known for his large-scale narrative history paintings featuring black figures—defiant assertions of blackness in a medium in which African Americans have long been invisible—and his exploration of art history covers a broad temporal swath stretching from the Renaissance to 20th-century American abstraction. Marshall critically examines and reworks the Western canon through its most archetypal forms: the historical tableau, landscape and genre painting, and portraiture. His work also touches upon vernacular forms such as the muralist tradition and the comic book in order to address and correct, in his words, the ""vacuum in the image bank"" and to make the invisible visible.

2016,Valentin de Boulogne: Beyond Caravaggio,"October 7, 2016–January 22, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/valentin-de-boulogne,"The greatest French follower of Caravaggio (1571–1610), Valentin de Boulogne (1591–1632) was also one of the outstanding artists in 17th-century Europe. In the years following Caravaggio's death, he emerged as one of the most original protagonists of the new, naturalistic painting. This is the first monographic exhibition devoted to Valentin, who is little known because his career was short-lived—he died at age 41—and his works are so rare. Around 60 paintings by Valentin survive, and this exhibition brings together 45 of them, with works coming from Rome, Vienna, Munich, Madrid, London, and Paris. Exceptionally, the Musée du Louvre, which possesses the most important and extensive body of Valentin's works, is lending all of its paintings by the artist. Although he is not well known to the general public, Valentin has long been admired by those with a passion for Caravaggesque painting. His work was a reference point for the great realists of the 19th century, from Courbet to Manet, and his startlingly vibrant staging of dramatic events and the deep humanity of his figures, who seem touched by a pervasive melancholy, make his work unforgettable. #ValentindeBoulogne Now at The Met Blog Series Learn more about Valentin de Boulogne and the themes of this exhibition in a series of blog posts written by Keith Christiansen and guest authors.

Multiple competitive and complementary religious traditions, fueled by an almost universal preoccupation with the city, gave rise to one of the most creative periods in its history. This landmark exhibition demonstrates the key role that the Holy City played in shaping the art of the period from 1000 to 1400. In these centuries, Jerusalem was home to more cultures, religions, and languages than ever before. Through times of peace as well as war, Jerusalem remained a constant source of inspiration that resulted in art of great beauty and fascinating complexity. This exhibition is the first to unravel the various cultural traditions and aesthetic strands that enriched and enlivened the medieval city.

Unlike many old masters for whom drawing was a preparatory tool, Fragonard explored the potential of chalk, ink, and wash to create sheets that were works of art in their own right. As displays of virtuosity and an imaginative spirit, his drawings have been prized highly from his own day to the present, and New York has long been a center for collecting these works. This exhibition celebrates the artist's achievements as a master draftsman. Among the 100 works on paper on view, nearly half are from private collections, some of which are being shown publicly for the first time. A similar brio and inventiveness mark the artist's etchings, and examples of these are also featured in the selection.

In 1984, Heinz Berggruen and his family donated 90 works by Paul Klee to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. These 11 paintings, 71 watercolors, and 8 black-and-white drawings constitute one of the most important gifts in the history of the Museum. Overnight The Met became a major center for the study of this German artist. The earliest work in the collection is a precisely penciled view of Bern drawn in 1893, when Klee was 13 years old, and the latest is a gouache painted in the year of his death. More than half of the works in the collection were executed during the painter's most active years, 1921 through 1931, when he taught at the Bauhaus, first in Weimar and then in Dessau. Marcel Breuer, the architect of The Met Breuer, was also a faculty member and colleague of Klee's at the Bauhaus. #PaulKlee #MetBreuer An Interview with Felix Klee Read a 1986 interview (PDF) with Paul Klee's son, Felix, conducted by exhibition curator Sabine Rewald, in which Felix reminisces about life with his father.

2016,Benjamin Franklin,"August 22–November 28, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/benjamin-franklin,"This exhibition features several works depicting the brilliant writer, inventor, politician, patriot, and statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), who has been the subject of hundreds of portraits. The most famous of these was painted by Joseph Siffred Duplessis (1725–1802), Louis XVI's official portraitist, after Franklin arrived in Paris in 1776 to seek French support for the American war of independence. Portraying Franklin in a red coat with a fur collar and with an astonishingly elaborate frame decorated with his attributes, the oval painting was greatly admired and Duplessis exhibited it at the 1779 Paris Salon. The painting, which has been in The Met collection for 85 years, is a focal point of the exhibition, along with the preliminary pastel portrait of Franklin, a life study by Duplessis. The pastel, which is rarely exhibited and is on loan from the New York Public Library, shows Franklin in the same pose as the painting but wearing a gray, collarless jacket and waistcoat. The image will be familiar to many: it is the likeness that is replicated on the one-hundred-dollar bill. The installation also explores the processes of image transfer and replication in the 18th century. Franklin arrived in Paris on December 21, 1776, as a commissioner of the American Continental Congress, and lived in nearby Passy until he returned to America in 1785. He promoted the treaty of alliance between the fledgling nation and the government of Louis XVI that was signed on February 6, 1778. The American Revolutionary War was an enormously popular cause in France, where the elderly statesman's simplicity of dress and manner were admired. The ""Fur Collar Portrait,"" or ""VIR Portrait,"" by Duplessis was commissioned by the entrepreneur Jacques Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont. The oval canvas, exhibited in the frame in which it is still displayed, became the object of extravagant praise. Versions from the artist's workshop and by other hands were in demand and the portrait was replicated dozens of times. A fine replica by or after Duplessis, also belonging to The Met, is so close in design that the contours must have been transferred from the 1778 picture. Franklin understood the importance of circulating his image and gave sittings to some half-dozen French artists, but he did not enjoy doing so. He did not wish to sit for the same painter twice, sending away in later years those who applied to him for an original and suggesting that they instead commission a copy. An X-radiograph of the ""Fur Collar Portrait"" reveals that Franklin's coat was originally much simpler, with small buttons and a narrow collar. In this connection, the exhibition draws attention to the Duplessis pastel portrait of Franklin that was given to the New York Public Library in 1896. For more than a century, the pastel has been conscientiously protected from damage due to overexposure to light and has thus rarely been exhibited. The pastel had been assigned to the early 1780s, but technical examination reveals that it dates to 1777 or early 1778 and is preliminary to the ""Fur Collar Portrait;"" its design precisely matches the composition revealed in the painting's X-radiograph. Pastel is a portable medium, and Duplessis probably took his pastel crayons to Passy to set down the direct likeness of Franklin."
2016,Diane Arbus: In the Beginning,"July 12–November 27, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/diane-arbus,"This landmark exhibition features more than 100 photographs that together redefine Diane Arbus (American, 1923–1971), one of the most influential and provocative artists of the 20th century. It focuses on the first seven years of her career, from 1956 to 1962, the period in which she developed the idiosyncratic style and approach for which she has been recognized praised, criticized, and copied the world over. Arbus made most of her photographs in New York City, where she lived and died, and where she worked in locations such as Times Square, the Lower East Side, and Coney Island. Her photographs of children and eccentrics, couples and circus performers, female impersonators and Fifth Avenue pedestrians are among the most intimate and surprising images of the era. The majority of the photographs in the exhibition have never before been seen and are part of the Museum's Diane Arbus Archive, acquired in 2007 by gift and promised gift from the artist's daughters, Doon Arbus and Amy Arbus. It was only when the archive came to The Met that this remarkable early work came to be fully explored.

2016,The Old Ball Game,"June 10–November 13, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/old-ball-game,"From the late 1940s to the late 1950s, New York was home to three of the best teams in professional baseball. On October 3, 1951, the New York Giants' Bobby Thomson hit a three-run homer against the Brooklyn Dodgers' Ralph Branca, earning the Giants a National League pennant with one of the most dramatic plays in the history of baseball. It was the bottom of the ninth inning in the final game of a tie-breaking playoff, and the Dodgers held a 4–2 lead. The game between the two longtime local rivals was televised from coast to coast and described in lively detail by Giants radio announcer Russ Hodges. With millions experiencing the play-by-play firsthand, Thomson's historic home run came to be known as the ""shot heard 'round the world."" The Giants then advanced to the World Series, where they faced another local—and seemingly invincible—team, the New York Yankees, to whom they lost in the sixth game. New York has been the site of some of baseball's most significant milestones since the mid-19th century, when the New York Knickerbockers was the first team to apply rules that still govern the sport today. It was here that Babe Ruth set multiple single-season home-run records as a Bronx Bomber and Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball when he started for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. This exhibition features baseball cards dating from 1887—when the Dodgers were called the Bridegrooms, the Giants were known as the Gothams, and the Yankees didn't yet exist—to 1977, when the Mets had replaced the Dodgers and Giants as New York's primary National League team. #OldBallGame"

Because of their sensitivity to light, these works—primarily children's books, illustrations, and prints—are rarely displayed. In addition to works from The Met collection, there are a dozen loans from a private collection and the New-York Historical Society. Among the highlights of the installation are nine original watercolors by Caldecott (1887) for the children's book The House That Jack Built ; the familiar illustration of Santa Claus by Nast from A Visit from Saint Nicholas (1872); and one of Homer's earliest illustrations, which was made for Eventful History of Three Blind Mice (1858). #PrintingaChildsWorld"
2016,Alex Katz at The Met,"October 9, 2015–November 6, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/alex-katz,"This exhibition, mounted in celebration of gifts both donated and promised to the Met, gathers works by Alex Katz (American, born 1927), one of our era's most acclaimed artists. Acquired through the generosity of Glenn Fuhrman, Leonard A. Lauder, and Katz himself, these works—eight in total, including two loans—span nearly the entire arc of Katz's career and include drawings, prints, and paintings. Among the works are two cutouts, the innovative artistic device that Katz pioneered in the late 1950s; a haunting cityscape; several portraits of Ada, Katz's wife and long-time muse; and portraits of luminaries from Katz's own social and artistic circles. Katz was born in Brooklyn in 1927 and came of age as an artist during the heyday of the New York School. In the late 1950s, he began to develop his mature style, one characterized by elegance, simplicity, and stylized abstraction. Committed to depicting recognizable motifs, Katz minimizes details and shading, choosing instead to summarize his subjects with the help of bold contours, blocks of color, and strategic swipes of the brush. As much as they represent a specific person or place, Katz's works also depict the act of seeing itself—that is, the peculiar mechanics of viewing, whether from afar or close up, whether on an empty street or across a crowded room. He captures the surprise and suspense, the desire and pleasure, that accompany the experience of spectatorship. #MetKatz"
2016,Phil Collins:how to make a refugee,"December 11, 2015–November 6, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/phil-collins,"Shot during the Kosovo War (1998Â­–99), how to make a refugee , by British artist Phil Collins (born 1970), addresses the depiction of war victims by journalists and documentarians. Here Collins brings a critical, self-conscious eye to the conventions governing the representation of suffering in the media. In this work, Collins captures the moments just before, during, and after a photo shoot organized by a team of journalists working in a camp in Macedonia. Their subject is a family of Kosovan-Albanian refugees. Over the course of the video, the artist grants very little specific insight into the family and the events that brought them to Macedonia, but provides a great deal of information about how carefully such photo shoots are orchestrated, always with an eye toward manipulating the emotional and political response of viewers. Collins is equally sensitive to the role that cameras play in mediating this relationship—one founded on equal parts suspicion and fascination, exploitation and advocacy—between those who do the depicting and those who are being depicted. Precisely how sitters and creators address one another through and across the camera lens is as much the topic of his video as the Kosovo War and the war refugees themselves. As Collins has said of how to make a refugee : ""A camera brings interested parties together. It attracts and repels according to circumstance or whim . . . You could say that [this work] is driven by an emotional relationship with the subjects, rather than the rational or sensational standards of journalism."""

2016,Dream States,"May 16–October 30, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/dream-states,"Artists have always turned to dreams as a source of inspiration, a retreat from reason, and a space for exploring imagination and desire. In the history of photography, dreams have been most closely associated with the Surrealists, who pushed the technical limits of the medium to transform the camera's realist documents into fantastical compositions. Whereas their modernist explorations were often bound to psychoanalytic theories, more recently contemporary photographers have pursued the world of sleep and dreams through increasingly open-ended works that succeed through evocation rather than description. This exhibition takes a cue from the artists it features by displaying a constellation of photographs that collectively evoke the experience of a waking dream. Here, a night sky composed of pills, a fragmented rainbow, a sleeping fairy-tale princess, and an alien underwater landscape illuminate hidden impulses and longings underlying contemporary life. Drawn entirely from The Met collection, Dream States features approximately 30 photographs and video works primarily from the 1970s to the present."

Because of their sensitivity to light, these works cannot be on permanent exhibition; each installation remains on view for approximately 13 weeks. The rotations of the gallery consist of diverse pieces—new acquisitions as well as works that might not find their way into a major exhibition. They are selected to show the breadth and quality of the Museum's holdings, ranging from the Renaissance to the present. Highlights from this rotation include a selection of drawings and prints centered on the theme of the allegory of America, anchored by Discovery of America: Vespucci Landing in America (ca. 1587-89) by the Netherlandish artist Stradanus; images of pairs, twins, and doublings in European works on paper from the 17th through the 19th century, including works by John Flaxman and Théodore Gericault; prints centered around a remarkable recently acquired landscape etching by Francisco Goya; a selection of prints from the portfolio Prints of the Mexican Revolution published in 1947; a selection devoted to printmaking in Genoa with a focus on a newly acquired etching by Bartolommeo Gazalis; drawings and prints that give an overview of the activity of Peter Candid, the Netherlandish-born 16th-century artist active in Florence and Munich, including a newly discovered double-sided study of Alexander the Great, which the Museum acquired in 2014 and is presented to the public for the first time in conjunction with the installation of a grand altarpiece by Candid in the European Paintings galleries (gallery 609); and images of art students and artists engaged in study from the 16th through the early 20th century."

Art is an annual celebration of achievement in the arts in New York City public schools. This juried exhibition of the work of talented young artists showcases the creativity of 90 prekindergarten through grade 12 students from all five boroughs and includes paintings, prints, sculptures, photographs, mixed-media works, collages, and drawings. Each piece demonstrates personal expression, imaginative use of media, the results of close observation, and an understanding of artistic processes. Dedicated art teachers support students' creativity and help them look closely in order to respond to their worlds through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and learn to harness their imaginations for artistic expression. A panel of arts specialists from the Department of Education and Studio in a School selected 420 semifinalists from 1,205 submissions. A jury of distinguished members of the New York City arts community, including staff of The Met, chose the works on display in P.S. Art 2016 .

These works in stone, ceramic, wood, and metal range from highly abstracted, minimalist representations of temples and houses to elaborate architectural complexes populated with figures. Such miniature structures were critical components in funerary practice and beliefs about an afterlife, and they convey a rich sense of ancient ritual as well as the daily lives of the Aztecs, the Incas, and their predecessors. This exhibition, the first of its kind in the United States, sheds light on the role of these objects in mediating relationships between the living, the dead, and the divine. It also provides a rare look at ancient American architecture, much of which did not survive to the present day. Some 30 remarkable loans from museums in the United States and Peru join works from The Met's permanent collection, which is particularly rich in this material. #DesignforEternity Featured Media Friday Focus ""...a tantalizing exhibition..."" — Wall Street Journal The exhibition is made possible by Jill and Alan Rappaport in honor of Joanne Pearson.

The display shows how select motifs, especially plants and animals, have been illustrated on ceramics, painting, sculpture, lacquer, and textiles, and what they mean. Some types of images and symbols are nearly universal across East Asia; others are specific to Korea. One section of the exhibit demonstrates a Korean penchant for abstraction and for amplifying the qualities of natural materials or distilling form and color. #MetKoreanArt"
2016,Divine Pleasures: Painting from India's Rajput Courts—The Kronos Collections,"June 14–September 12, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/divine-pleasures,"Compelling episodes from the epic and poetic literature of the Indian subcontinent dominate the nearly 100 masterful paintings—most a 2015 promised gift by Steven M. Kossak from his family's Kronos Collections—in this exhibition. Created mainly between the 16th and the early 19th century for the royal courts of Rajasthan and the Punjab Hills in northern India, the works on view are meant to move the soul and delight the eye. The collection was assembled over nearly four decades by Mr. Kossak, formerly a curator in The Met's Department of Asian Art. Rajput court painting was mainly intended for royal delectation, to amplify—through the artistic fantasy manifest in the pictures—well-known religious, quasi-religious, and secular texts and subjects. Under the patronage of their Rajput rulers, many of the principalities of north India developed and nurtured a distinctive painting style that expressed a new way of seeking the divine through bhakti , or personal devotion. This galaxy of stylistic expression is amply demonstrated in the exhibition through compelling examples of the Early Rajput Style; the later schools of Bikaner, Bundi, Kishangarh, Kota, and Mewar; as well as many of the small courts of the Punjab Hills: Bahu, Bahsoli, Bislalpur, Chamba, Guler, Kangra, Mandi, Mankot, and Nurpur. Many of the paintings have never before been exhibited publicly. Accompanied by a publication The catalogue is made possible by The Peter Jay Sharp Foundation."

Featuring 60 exquisite and unusual pieces, this presentation will challenge the long-standing, and overly rigid, tradition of cataloguing Chinese ceramics as domestic or trade items. In addition to exploring the trade in Chinese ceramics within Asia, the exhibition will focus on the development of shapes and designs that reflect the long history of exchange between China and the Islamic world as well as the period—the late 16th century—when works reflecting both the Chinese and Islamic traditions were introduced and incorporated into Europe and the Americas. This exhibition will also explore the ways in which 18th-century artists, when faced with the global idioms that had developed at the time, made artistic choices that allowed them to create an endless range of spectacular and visually imaginative works. On loan to The Met from an important Brazilian private collection, the porcelains in Global by Design have never before been exhibited. #GlobalbyDesign Featured Media"
2016,Manus × Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology,"May 5–September 5, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/manus-x-machina,"The Costume Institute's spring 2016 exhibition explores how fashion designers are reconciling the handmade and the machine-made in the creation of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear. With more than 170 ensembles dating from the early 20th century to the present, the exhibition addresses the founding of the haute couture in the 19th century, when the sewing machine was invented, and the emergence of a distinction between the hand (manus) and the machine (machina) at the onset of mass production. It explores this ongoing dichotomy, in which hand and machine are presented as discordant tools in the creative process, and questions the relationship and distinction between haute couture and ready-to-wear. The Robert Lehman Wing galleries, on the Museum's first floor and ground level, have been transformed into a building-within-a-building using white scrims. The space houses a series of case studies in which haute couture and ready-to-wear ensembles are decoded to reveal their hand/machine DNA. A 2014 haute couture wedding dress by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel with a 20-foot train occupies a central cocoon, with details of its embroidery projected onto the domed ceiling. The scuba knit ensemble, one of the inspirations for the exhibition, stands as a superlative example of the confluence between the handmade and the machine-made–the pattern on the train was hand-painted with gold metallic pigment, machine-printed with rhinestones, and hand-embroidered with pearls and gemstones. #ManusxMachina Featured Media Gallery Views Red Carpet Arrivals ""The show is unusually thoughtful — a stately, gorgeous tutorial… exceptional …ravishing exhibition.""— New York Times ""Can machine-made fashion dazzle like handmade couture?

2016,Unfinished,"March 18–September 4, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/unfinished,"This exhibition addresses a subject critical to artistic practice: the question of when a work of art is finished. Beginning with the Renaissance masters, this scholarly and innovative exhibition examines the term ""unfinished"" in its broadest possible sense, including works left incomplete by their makers, which often give insight into the process of their creation, but also those that partake of a non finito —intentionally unfinished—aesthetic that embraces the unresolved and open-ended. Some of history's greatest artists explored such an aesthetic, among them Titian, Rembrandt, Turner, and Cézanne. The unfinished has been taken in entirely new directions by modern and contemporary artists, among them Janine Antoni, Lygia Clark, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Rauschenberg, who alternately blurred the distinction between making and un-making, extended the boundaries of art into both space and time, and recruited viewers to complete the objects they had begun. Comprising 197 works dating from the Renaissance to the present—approximately 40 percent of which are drawn from the Museum's own collection, enhanced by major national and international loans—this exhibition demonstrates The Met's unique capacity to mine its rich collection and scholarly resources to present modern and contemporary art within a deep historical context. #MetUnfinished #MetBreuer Featured Media Sunday at The Met Unfinished: New Directions ""The show is a non-stop sequence of arousals and exhilarations.""— The New Yorker ""As philosophically rich as it is aesthetically rewarding""— Boston Globe ""[The exhibition] illuminates the process of both making and looking at art in remarkable ways.""— New York Times The exhibition is made possible by Leonard A.

Some of the teens regarded themselves as artists; others were experimenting with art for the first time. Half of the group worked with Artist in Residence Peter Hristoff, examining aspects of rug design such as composition, repetition, and symbolism. They produced designs that weavers at Can Carpet in Camlik, Turkey, wove into rugs. The other half worked with Jonny Goldstein, a visual notetaker, to use close listening and quick sketching as a creative art form. All of the interns explored art from different cultures—including that of the exhibition Court and Cosmos: The Great Age of the Seljuqs —to create works that express something of personal importance.

2016,Turner's Whaling Pictures,"May 10–August 7, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/turner-whaling-pictures,"This focus exhibition is the first to unite the series of four whaling scenes made by the British landscapist Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851) near the end of his career. The quartet of paintings—comprising The Met's Whalers and its three companions in the Tate, London—were among the last seascapes exhibited by Turner, for whom marine subjects were a creative mainstay. Shown in pairs at the Royal Academy in London in 1845 and 1846, the whaling canvases confounded critics with their ""tumultuous surges"" of brushwork and color, which threatened to obscure the motif, yet the pictures earned admiration for the brilliance and vitality of their overall effects. The exhibition also highlights connections between Turner's whaling scenes and Herman Melville's 1851 whaling epic Moby-Dick . It is not certain that Melville saw the paintings when he first visited London in 1849, but he was unquestionably aware of them, and aspects of his novel are strikingly evocative of Turner's style. The exhibition offers viewers an opportunity to assess for themselves whether the British artist inspired one of the crowning achievements of American literature. #MetTurner The exhibition is made possible by the William S. Lieberman Fund, the Janice H. Levin Fund, and the Lillian Goldman Charitable Trust. The publication is made possible by the William S. Lieberman Fund.

2016,Crime Stories,"March 7–July 31, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/crime-stories,"Since the earliest days of the medium, photographs have been used for criminal investigation and evidence gathering, to record crime scenes, to identify suspects and abet their capture, and to report events to the public. This exhibition explores the multifaceted intersections between photography and crime, from 19th-century ""rogues' galleries"" to work by contemporary artists inspired by criminal transgression. The installation will feature some 70 works, drawn entirely from The Met collection, ranging from the 1850s to the present. Among the highlights of the installation is Alexander Gardner's documentation of the events following the assassination of President Lincoln, as well as rare forensic photographs by Alphonse Bertillon, the French criminologist who created the system of criminal identification that gave rise to the modern mug shot. Also on display is a vivid selection of vintage news photographs related to cases both obscure and notorious, such as a study of John Dillinger's feet in a Chicago morgue in 1934; Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963; and Patty Hearst captured by bank surveillance cameras in 1974. In addition to exploring photography's evidentiary uses, the exhibition will feature work by artists who have drawn inspiration from the criminal underworld, including Richard Avedon, Larry Clark, Walker Evans, John Gutmann, Andy Warhol, and Weegee. #CrimeStories #MetOnPaper100"
2016,The Secret Life of Textiles: Plant Fibers,"March 7–July 31, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/plant-fibers,"Fibers are the most important components of a textile. Everything related to the production of a textile—yarns, dyes, weaving, and patterns—begins with and is determined by the type and quality of the fibers. At The Met, the Museum's comprehensive textile collection, the conservators' expertise, and state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation come together to make possible a detailed examination of fiber characteristics and technology through a series of three installations that will be focused on plant fibers, animal fibers, and synthetic fibers. This first installation in the series reveals the technological transformation and beauty of the most important plant fibers—linen, hemp, ramie, and cotton—used by various cultures around the world in North Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas, from the Dynastic period of Egypt to the present day."
2016,Court and Cosmos,"April 27–July 24, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/court-and-cosmos,"One of the most productive periods in the history of the region from Iran to Anatolia corresponds to the rule of the Seljuqs and their immediate successors, from 1038 to 1307. The Seljuqs were a Turkic dynasty of Central Asian nomadic origin that in short time conquered a vast territory in West Asia stretching from present-day Turkmenistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. The lands controlled by the Seljuqs were not a unified empire, but controlled by various branches of the Seljuqs and their successor dynasties (Rum Seljuqs, Artuqids, Zangids, and others). Under Seljuq rule, the exchange and synthesis of diverse traditions—including Turkmen, Perso-Arabo-Islamic, Byzantine, Armenian, Crusader, and other Christian cultures—accompanied economic prosperity, advances in science and technology, and a great flowering of culture within the realm. This landmark international loan exhibition will feature spectacular works of art created in the 11th through 13th century from Turkmenistan to the Mediterranean. Approximately 270 objects—including ceramics, glass, stucco, works on paper, woodwork, textiles, and metalwork—from American, European, and Middle Eastern public and private collections will be shown. Many of the institutions have never lent works from their collections before. Among the highlights will be a dozen important loans from Turkmenistan, marking the first time that Turkmenistan as an independent country has permitted an extended loan of a group of objects to a museum in the United States. Under the Great Seljuqs of Iran, the middle class prospered, spurring arts patronage, technological advancements, and a market for luxury goods. In contrast, in Anatolia and the Jazira (northwestern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey)—which were controlled by the Seljuq successor dynasties—art was produced under royal patronage, and Islamic iconography was introduced to a predominantly Christian area. Furthermore, a number of artists had immigrated to the region from Iran in response to the Mongol conquest in 1220. Because patrons, consumers, and artists came from diverse cultural, religious, and artistic backgrounds, distinctive arts were produced and flourished in the western parts of the Seljuq realm. #CourtandCosmos Featured Media ""...deliciously diverse and unexpected""— Apollo The exhibition is made possible by the NoRuz at The Met Fund and the Iranian-American Community.

2016,Monkey Business,"January 8–July 24, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/monkey-business,"The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating twelve-year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the twelve animals in the East Asian zodiac. This Lunar New Year, which begins on February 8, 2016, is the Year of the Monkey. In celebration, the Metropolitan Museum is pleased to present this small exhibition in the Charlotte C. Weber Galleries for the Arts of Ancient China, featuring depictions of monkeys in various media—including painting, ceramics, metalwork, and jade carving. The earliest-known record of these zodiac animals is from China's Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 A.D.) and dates to the first century. In sequence, the twelve animals are: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each animal is believed to embody certain traits expressed in the character of the people born in that year. People born in the Year of the Monkey are thought to be intelligent, energetic, and playful. The monkey has been a popular decorative figure in Asian art for over two millennia, often serving as a rebus or visual pun conveying the notion of academic success or accomplishment. In a fan painting from the late twelfth century that depicts three gibbons raiding an egret's nest, the gibbon acts as a visual pun, because the Chinese word for gibbon ( yuan ) is a homophone for ""first place in the civil exam."" Similarly, in a porcelain plate from the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, a depiction of monkeys conveys a wish for high rank, as the Chinese word for monkey ( hou ) is a homophone for ""marquis,"" or ""commander."" The Chinese lunar calendar and its associated iconography eventually spread to Korea, Japan, and Chinese communities throughout Southeast Asia. While the symbolism of the Chinese lunar calendar is distinct to East Asia, images of monkeys, characterized by intelligence, lively spirit, and mischievous behavior, have universal appeal and are found in the decorative art of many cultures around the globe. #YearoftheMonkey #AsianArt100"

The rotations of the gallery consist of diverse pieces—new acquisitions as well as works that might not find their way into a major exhibition. They are selected to show the breadth and quality of the Museum's holdings, ranging from the Renaissance to the present. Highlights from this rotation include works by the 18th-century Dutch artist Dirk Langendijk, including several recent acquisitions; 17th-century Flemish drawings related to sculpture, including one by Jacob Jordaens; a group of drawings and prints depicting women sewing and reading in the intimacy of their home by Neo-Impressionist artists such as Georges Seurat, Theo Van Rysselberghe, and Paul Signac; large-scale portrait drawings by 19th- and 20th-century artists centered around a recently acquired work by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres; recently acquired British watercolors including works by David Cox, John Brett, and Sir John Poynter; French and English etching-revival prints by Francis Seymour Haden, James McNeil Whistler, David Young Cameron, and Charles Meryon; and—to mark the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare—a selection of prints, drawings, and illustrated books created between 1789 and 1930 by an international roster of artists who were inspired by the Bard."
2016,Richard Tuttle:The Critical Edge,"April 2–July 17, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/richard-tuttle,"One of the most significant artists working today, Richard Tuttle first came to prominence in the heady years of the 1960s, when he gained critical recognition for a body of work that used humble, mundane materials such as textile, paper, wire, and rope—materials that have remained the cornerstone of his practice. This installation features a series of six new works made from fabric purchased in New York and Maine, along with 10 paintings. Together they elaborate Tuttle's interest in abstraction, texture, and materiality, as well as his long-standing use of cloth as a medium. An astute collector of textiles, Tuttle builds his assemblages from layers of fabric that are cut and sewn by hand, sometimes with the aid of a sewing machine. From these fragments he fashions idiosyncratic shapes and eccentric compositions, many endowed with a clumsy yet evocative three-dimensionality. The works result from a kind of collaboration between the artist and the textiles he selects—the fabric, for instance, provides the objects with both their color and their form. In keeping with his playful insistence on refusing to be categorized, Tuttle uses elements of drawing, painting, weaving, and sculpture to create these hybrid objects. Accordingly, both embroidery and the cloth's overlapping edges function as drawn lines. The pliable pieces of draped fabric, similarly, are responsive to the surrounding environment: shifts in the air cause them to rise and fall in a manner suggestive of breathing. Because the pieces vary in their degree of opacity and transparency, they each catch and release light in different ways. For these reasons, Tuttle's works are highly sensual objects that activate our sense of sight and touch. Furthermore, by alluding to philosophical inquiry, the objects' shared title, The Critical Edge , suggests that the works reach beyond art to become meditations on the nature of perception and understanding. #RichardTuttle The exhibition is made possible by The Modern Circle."

Alexander's retinue of court artists and extensive artistic patronage provided a model for his successors, the Hellenistic kings, who came to rule over much of his empire. For the first time in the United States, a major international loan exhibition will focus on the astonishing wealth, outstanding artistry, and technical achievements of the Hellenistic period—the three centuries between Alexander's death, in 323 B.C., and the establishment of the Roman Empire, in the first century B.C. This exhibition will bring together some 264 artworks that were created through the patronage of the royal courts of the Hellenistic kingdoms, with an emphasis on the ancient city of Pergamon. Examples in diverse media—from marble, bronze, and terracotta sculptures to gold jewelry, vessels of glass and engraved gems, and precious metals and coins—reveal the enduring legacy of Hellenistic artists and their profound influence on Roman art. The ancient city of Pergamon (now known as Bergama, in present-day Turkey) was the capital of the Attalid Dynasty that ruled over large parts of Asia Minor. The exhibition represents a historic collaboration between The Met and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, whose celebrated sculptures will comprise approximately one-third of the works on view. Numerous prominent museums in Greece, the Republic of Italy, other European countries, Morocco, Tunisia, and the United States will also be represented, often through objects that have never before left their museum collections. #MetPergamon Featured Media ""Blockbuster""— Wall Street Journal ""The exhibition's scale and scope are colossal""— The New Yorker ""An exhilarating survey""— Financial Times The exhibition is made possible by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and Betsy and Edward Cohen / Areté Foundation.

Demand by museums and collectors—especially for figural and highly decorated works—promoted commercial and research excavations, and led to the custom of repairing, filling in, and enhancing fragmentary and deteriorated examples.

When exposed to oxygen and humidity, lacquer hardens or polymerizes, becoming a natural plastic and an ideal protective covering for screens, trays, and other implements. Mixed with pigments, particularly cinnabar (red) and carbon (black), lacquer has been also used as an artistic media for millennia.

2016,Chinese Textiles,"August 15, 2015–June 19, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/chinese-textiles,"This installation, which explores the cultural importance of silk in China, showcases the most important and unusual textiles from the Museum's collection. In addition to three rare pieces dating from the Tang dynasty (618–906), when China served as a cultural hub linking Korea and Japan to Central and West Asia, and ultimately to the Mediterranean world, the exhibition also includes eleventh- and twelfth-century tapestries from Central Asia, as well as contemporaneous Chinese examples of this technique. Spectacular embroideries—including an imperial fourteenth-century canopy decorated with phoenixes and flowers, and a monumental late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century panel showing phoenixes in a garden—are also on view, together with theatrical garments, court costumes, and early examples of badges worn at court to designate rank. #ChineseTextiles #AsianArt100 The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

Burdick,"October 21, 2015–June 9, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/burdick-collection-october-rotation,"The Burdick baseball card collection constitutes an integral part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of ephemera and tells the history of popular printmaking in the United States. In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of approximately 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 270,000 trade and postcards, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1959 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

The centerpiece of the three-part exhibition is the opulent Worsham-Rockefeller Dressing Room from the New York City house commissioned by art collector and philanthropist Arabella Worsham (later Huntington; ca. 1850–1924). A complete work of art, with its elaborate woodwork and decorations, it is a rare surviving commission by the New York–based cabinetmaker and interior decorator George A. Schastey (American, 1839–1894). Although little known today, Schastey operated a large and successful decorating firm in the late nineteenth century, catering to some of the nation's wealthiest individuals. Loans from public and private collections will highlight his work and important role; some of these works are newly attributed to him and have never before been on public view. The exhibition will also include furniture by some of Schastey's contemporaries. An adjoining gallery will display works by Schastey's best-known competitor, Herter Brothers, that were created for the firm's most important commission, the William H. Vanderbilt House. In total, the exhibition will include more than three dozen examples of furniture from America's Gilded Age. Visitors will gain new insights into the luxurious and artistic interiors found in New York's wealthiest households in the late nineteenth century. #GildedAgeFurniture Accompanied by a Bulletin Featured Media ""Opulent.""— Wall Street Journal Artistic Furniture of the Gilded Age: George A.

Her minimalist practice not only adds a rich layer to the history of South Asian art but also necessitates an expansion of the narratives of international modernism. The Met Breuer exhibition, the first museum retrospective of the artist's work in the United States, is an important part of the Met's initiative to explore and present the global scope of modern and contemporary art. Mohamedi mainly worked with gestures of pencil and ink on paper, experimenting with organic forms, delicate grids, and dynamic, hard-edged lines. Her cosmopolitan outlook enabled her to draw upon a range of aesthetic sensibilities, from the poetry of Rilke and Camus, as well as Indian classical music, to the modernist architecture of Le Corbusier's Chandigarh. Spanning Mohamedi's entire career and bringing together more than 130 paintings, drawings, photographs, and rarely seen diaries, the exhibition traces the conceptual complexity and visual subtlety of the artist's oeuvre. #NasreenMohamedi #MetBreuer Featured Media The Restrained Discipline of Line: Nasreen Mohamedi The Maximum out of the Minimum: Reconsidering Nasreen Mohamedi The exhibition is made possible by Nita and Mukesh Ambani and the Reliance Foundation.

2016,The Power of Prints,"January 26–May 22, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/power-of-prints,"""Prints throw open to their students with the most complete abandon the whole gamut of human life and endeavor, from the most ephemeral of courtesies to the loftiest pictorial presentation of man's spiritual aspirations."" —William M. Ivins This exhibition commemorates the centenary of the Department of Prints at The Metropolitan Museum of Art by celebrating the astounding legacy of its founding curator, William Mills Ivins, and his brilliant protégé A. Hyatt Mayor. Together, during their combined fifty-year tenure, Ivins and Mayor amassed a collection of many hundreds of thousands of prints that is both encyclopedic in its scope and studied in its many areas of focus. By drawing on its own vast holdings, this exhibition reveals how the Met's print collection was artfully constructed according to the vision of Ivins and Mayor—both social historians and amateur print specialists. The exhibition will show how the print collection of the Museum was meant to be like a library, composed from the beginning as a corpus of works (not all distinctly masterful works of art) that describe, in the most comprehensive way, man's aspirations. It will display the most beautiful, rare, and exceptional prints alongside the equally important popular and ephemeral works that were collected in the first fifty years of the department's history. The exhibition tells the story of this great American collection through prints by Andrea Mantegna, Marcantonio Raimondi, Albrecht Dürer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Jacques Callot, Francisco de Goya, James McNeill Whistler, Mary Cassatt, Edward Hopper, Honoré Daumier, Edward Penfield, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, to name just a few artists in the exhibition. The Power of Prints explores how the evolution of curatorial priorities—notably from purely aesthetic concerns to those of content and context—affected the building of the department's remarkable stock of etchings and engravings. The exhibition also, like Ivins and Mayor, approaches printed matter as the first entrée into the information age, as functional objects that were meant to spread information to an ever-widening public and, in turn, to reflect the changing aspects of any given society. #PowerofPrints #MetonPaper100 Featured Media Sunday at The MetâThe Power of Prints: The Pursuit of Knowledge and the Potential for Social Change The exhibition is made possible by The Schiff Foundation.

2016,Vigée Le Brun: Woman Artist in Revolutionary France,"February 15–May 15, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/vigee-le-brun,"Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (French, 1755–1842) is one of the finest 18th-century French painters and among the most important of all women artists. An autodidact with exceptional skills as a portraitist, she achieved success in France and Europe during one of the most eventful, turbulent periods in European history. In 1776, she married the leading art dealer in Paris; his profession at first kept her from being accepted into the prestigious Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. Nevertheless, through the intervention of Marie Antoinette, she was admitted at the age of 28 in 1783, becoming one of only four women members. Obliged to flee France in 1789 because of her association with the queen, she traveled to Italy, where in 1790 she was elected to membership in the Accademia di San Luca, Rome. Independently, she worked in Florence, Naples, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Berlin before returning to France, taking sittings from, among others, members of the royal families of Naples, Russia, and Prussia. While in exile, she exhibited at the Paris Salons. She was remarkable not only for her technical gifts but for her understanding of and sympathy with her sitters. This is the first retrospective and only the second exhibition devoted to Vigée Le Brun in modern times. The 80 works on view include paintings and a few pastels from European and American public and private collections. #VigeeLeBrun Featured Media Sunday at The Met The exhibition is made possible by the Sherman Fairchild Foundation, the Gail and Parker Gilbert Fund, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, and the Diane W. and James E.

2016,A New Look at a Van Eyck Masterpiece,"January 25–April 24, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/van-eyck,"This focus exhibition presents the findings of a recent study of the Crucifixion and Last Judgment paintings (ca. 1440–41) by Jan van Eyck and his workshop. These paintings and their frames have undergone technical investigations in an effort to solve long-standing mysteries about them. Whether the paintings were always intended as a diptych, or whether they were originally the wings of a triptych or the doors of a tabernacle, has been in question. The answer may be found not only in a closer look at the frames, but also in the relationship of the Metropolitan's Crucifixion painting to a recently rediscovered drawing of the Crucifixion attributed to Jan van Eyck (ca. 1390–1441) that has been acquired by the Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam, and is also on view in the exhibition. New infrared reflectography now affords an opportunity to compare the underdrawings of the Crucifixion and Last Judgment paintings with the Rotterdam drawing. In addition, X-radiography of the paintings' frames has revealed another text, albeit very damaged and fragmentary, on the flat part of the frame beneath the gold overpaint. The text is in Flemish, in Gothic minuscule script, as opposed to the Latin pastiglia (raised lettering) on the interior cove of the two frames. This introduces new clues regarding the original form and function of the two paintings, as the exhibition demonstrates."

These include The Cloisters Playing Cards , which will form the core of this small exhibition highlighting one of the more intriguing works of secular art from The Cloisters Collection. Examples of cards from the earliest hand-painted woodblock deck as well as fifteenth-century German engraved cards, north Italian tarot cards of the same period, and the finest deck from the early sixteenth century will complete the display.

2016,Wordplay,"January 8–April 11, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/wordplay,"This installation of drawings, prints, and related ephemera by the German artist and performer Matthias Buchinger (1674–1739) explores for the first time the oeuvre of the so-called Little Man of Nuremberg. Standing only twenty-nine inches high, and born without hands or feet, Buchinger was celebrated in his own time as a draftsman and calligrapher as well as a magician and musician. He boasted a clientele that included noblemen, kings, and emperors, along with members of the public who visited him at inns and fairs from Leipzig to Paris and from London to Belfast. Buchinger's remarkably delicate drawings often exploited flowing lines of microscopic texts to build up figures and elaborate scenes, an ancient Jewish technique known as micrography. The vast majority also incorporate calligraphic inscriptions that describe his physical condition as well as his artistic and personal triumphs. His main subjects include family trees, coats of arms, the Ten Commandments, and portraits. The works on display are drawn primarily from the collection of the master conjurer and author Ricky Jay. Framing them are works on paper from the Met's collection, dating from the late Middle Ages to the present day, that artfully play with words or typography. #MatthiasBuchinger #MetonPaper100"
2016,The Luxury of Time,"November 16, 2015–March 27, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/luxury-of-time,"Time is all around us, displayed on our phones and computers. Today, almost nobody needs to own a watch or a clock to tell the time. Access to the right time is not the luxury it once was. Yet the fascination with clocks and watches persists, and the thriving market for mechanical timekeepers is deeply aware of their history. Clocks and watches have always been about more than just telling time: they have been treasured as objects of desire and wonder, personal items imbued with value that goes beyond pure functionality. As works of art, they represent the marriage of innovation and craftsmanship. This exhibition explores the relationship between the artistry of the exterior form of European timekeepers and the brilliantly conceived technology that they contain. Drawn from the Museum's distinguished collection of German, French, English, and Swiss horology from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century, the extraordinary objects on view show how clocks and watches were made into lavish furniture or exquisite jewelry. The creation of timekeepers required that clockmakers work with cabinetmakers, goldsmiths and silversmiths, enamelers, chasers and gilders, engravers, and even those working in sculpture and porcelain. These craftsmen were tasked with accommodating internal mechanisms by producing cases that, in both shape and function, adapted to timekeeping technologies. Their exteriors are often as complicated as the movements they house. Examining the dialogue between inside and out, adornment and ingenuity, The Luxury of Time reveals the complex evolution of European clockmaking and the central place of timekeepers in the history of decorative arts. #LuxuryofTime Featured Media Pair-Case Watch by Daniel Delander Sunday at The MetâMaking Time: Clocks and Watches The publication is made possible by Marica and Jan Vilcek."
2016,Korea,"February 7, 2015–March 27, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/korea,"When the Department of Far Eastern Art was established at the Metropolitan in the summer of 1915, the Museum possessed only sixty-five Korean works. Some were mistakenly catalogued as Chinese or Japanese. Dubbed the ""hermit kingdom,"" Korea was then little known to the Western world. Today, its traditional arts, as well as pop music, film, and drama, are celebrated markers of global culture. The Museum's collection of Korean art, too, has been significantly transformed and continues to evolve. It now encompasses ceramics, paintings, sculpture, metalwork, lacquer ware, and textiles from the late Bronze Age to the present. Works on view include important recent gifts to the Museum from the Mary Griggs Burke Collection and Florence and Irving Collection—including a rare sixteenth-century Buddhist painting of royal commission, a striking mid-seventeenth-century gilt-wood statue of a Bodhisattva, and exquisite mother-of-pearl inlaid lacquer boxes from the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). The stories behind the objects in this exhibition capture the individuals and trends that shaped the Met's distinctive collection, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally. This presentation also reveals the modern Western imagination of Korea, and the many ways Korean art came to be viewed and appreciated in America. #MetKoreanArt #AsianArt100 The exhibition is made possible by Samsung."
2016,Reconstructions,"September 21, 2015–March 14, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/reconstructions,"This installation, the thirteenth since the Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography opened in 2007, is a snapshot—not comprehensive, but representative—of the collecting interests of the Department of Photographs through recently acquired works made by fifteen artists over the last seven years. While the title is taken from a photograph in the exhibition, the concept of reconstruction chimes with many of the works, which can be viewed, at least in part, as indirect addresses to how perception and cognition are being remapped to accommodate our newly bifurcated existences—online and ""in real life."" The notion that we swim in a sea of photographic images that shape how we see ourselves and the world felt new in 1989 and prescient in 1968, but with the rise of the Internet and social media, this condition is so obvious as to be useless. With one foot in cyberspace and the other on an unstable terrain of accelerated change, our daily life and deepest subjective recesses—our relationship to ourselves, each other, and to things—is constantly being reconstructed along digital lines, with cameras serving as almost bodily appendages to interface between these two realities. In this context, the seamless digital ""restoration"" of dazzle camouflage to a WWII battleship, the viral spread of Photoshop mishaps in an interior view, or the simple folding back of a book page can be seen as complex negotiations between the old order and the new networks that silently and invisibly are shaping individual and collective experience. #MetReconstructions"
2016,The Aftermath of Conflict,"August 24, 2015–March 6, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/jo-ractliffe,"Throughout her career, South African photographer Jo Ractliffe (born 1961) has directed her camera toward landscapes to address themes of displacement, conflict, history, memory, and erasure. This exhibition brings together selected works from three of her recent photographic series that focus on the aftermath of the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002) and its relationship with the Border War (1966–89) fought by South Africans in Angola and present-day Namibia. For Ractliffe and many other South African civilians, Angola during these wars was an abstract place, a ""secret, unspoken location where brothers and boyfriends were sent as part of their military service."" When seen consecutively, these three series reveal Ractliffe's deepening engagement with the region's complex histories as an attempt to ""retrieve a place for memory."" The earliest series, Terreno Ocupado (2007–8), was produced during Ractliffe's first visit to Angola's capital, Luanda, five years after the end of the Civil War. These images highlight the structural instability of the capital's shantytowns and question what it means for land to be occupied, abandoned, and struggled over. While working on As Terras do Fim do Mundo (2009–10), Ractliffe traveled alongside ex-soldiers returning to the desolate places in the Angolan countryside where they had fought. The Borderlands (2011–13) examines the impact of the wars in Angola within South Africa's borders. For this most recent project, she photographed militarized landscapes that had been occupied by the South African army, tracing histories of displacement that began during the colonial and apartheid periods and continue to unfold today. The photographs in all three series were originally produced as either gelatin silver prints or archival pigment prints on cotton paper; the inkjet prints on display here were made by the artist specially for this exhibition. This exhibition has been organized to coincide with Kongo: Power and Majesty , which focuses on works created by artists in present-day Angola between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. #JoRactliffe"

The thematic show features about sixty ensembles of haute couture and ready-to-wear primarily from de Ribes's personal archive, dating from 1962 to the present. Also included are her creations for fancy-dress balls, which she often made by cutting and cannibalizing her haute couture gowns to create nuanced expressions of her aesthetic. These, along with photographs, video, and ephemera, tell the story of how her interest in fashion developed over decades, from childhood ""dress-up"" to the epitome of international style. A muse to haute couture designers, de Ribes had at her disposal their drapers, cutters, and fitters in acknowledgment of their esteem for her taste and originality. Ultimately, she used this talent and experience to create her own successful design business, which she directed from 1982 to 1995. While the exhibition focuses on her taste and style, extensive documentation from her personal archives illustrates the range of her professional life, including her roles as theatrical impresario, television producer, interior designer, and director and organizer of international charity events. #JacquelinedeRibes Featured Media The Designer at Work ""…an eye-opening, perception-changing display of jaw-dropping couture gowns.""— InStyle ""…like walking into a fairy tale…the beauty and exquisite craftsmanship…provide visitors…transportation to a fantasy realm.""— Racked ""…more than just…pretty swaths of fabrics.

2016,Celebrating Sax,"November 6, 2014–February 21, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/celebrating-sax,"This special display of instruments made by three generations of the Sax family marks the bicentenary of the birth of Adolphe Sax. Rare saxophones, brass instruments, and an exquisite ivory clarinet are among the twenty-six instruments selected to showcase the inventions and innovations of this important family. There are few instrument makers who have become a household name. The eponymous instruments of Adolphe Sax have had a wide-reaching impact on music and society. Patented in 1846 and conceived as a military band and orchestral instrument, the saxophone is now integral to many different types of music around the world. Through jazz and pop, it achieved the type of universal popularity matched by few other instruments. During Sax's life, military and band music were transformed by saxhorns, his innovative family of brass instruments. The saxhorn fueled the brass band movement, which opened up music making to the working classes. Modern day euphoniums, tenor horns, and baritones are all descendants of the saxhorn family. The bicentenary of Adolphe Sax's birth also marks the 125th anniversary of the gift of over 3,600 instruments to the Met by the pioneering collector Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown. Sax was also an avid collector, active during a formative period of musical instrument scholarship. Many important instrument collections were established during his lifetime, including the one at the Metropolitan Museum. Sax and Brown circulated in the same international community of scholars and collectors, and instruments made by the Sax family featured prominently in Brown's collection as examples of cutting-edge instrument design. They continue to inspire performers, composers, and instrument makers."

While these are notably functional samplers, even with more decorative examples, the maker's skill and creativity were tempered by her adherence to traditional patterns, passed down over the years by means of earlier samplers, patterns books, or instructional manuals. Samplers were made as part of a young woman's education, either at a formal school or under informal tutelage at home. Through most of the eighteenth century, in both Europe and America, most girls were expected to learn only practical skills—basic reading, writing, and sums, along with sewing and cooking—to prepare them for their roles as wives, mothers, and homemakers. The Museum has more than eight hundred samplers from Europe and North America. The survival of so many of these embroideries indicates a continuing appreciation for the skill they demonstrate, for their charming variations on a theme, and, perhaps most of all, for the names of the makers, which were proudly added to many of these pieces when their work was done. For many, these samplers are the only remaining trace of the lives they lived. This installation is designed to complement Fashion and Virtue: Textile Patterns and the Print Revolution, 1520–1620 , on view October 20, 2015–January 10, 2016."

Verona's location at a significant crossroads between northern Italy and northern Europe encouraged Girolamo dai Libri and the members of the vibrant Veronese school to synthesize various influences, fusing the sculptural, classicizing style of nearby Padua, the luminous sensibility of Venetian painting, and the meticulous attention to naturalistic detail inspired by northern European artists. The focal point of this installation, comprised of works from the Museum's collection, is Girolamo's majestic altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with saints, on loan to the Robert Lehman Collection from the Department of European Paintings. Highlighting Girolamo's dual activities as a painter and illuminator, this altarpiece will be shown alongside manuscripts by Girolamo and his Veronese contemporaries, as well as drawings by this circle of artists."

During the Middle Kingdom (mid-Dynasty 11–Dynasty 13, around 2030–1650 B.C.), artistic, cultural, religious, and political traditions first conceived and instituted during the Old Kingdom were revived and reimagined. This transformational era is represented through 230 objects and groups in this major international exhibition. Fashioned with great subtlety and sensitivity, and ranging in size from monumental stone sculptures to delicate examples of jewelry, the works of art are drawn from the preeminent collection of the Metropolitan—which is particularly rich in Middle Kingdom material—and thirty-seven lenders in North America and Europe.

2016,Grand Illusions,"August 10, 2015–January 18, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/grand-illusions,"Photographers, like ventriloquists, can cast ""voices"" in a seemingly infinite number of genres and period styles. This does not negate the camera's direct relationship to the world—tying image to subject as naturally as a footprint—but instead reveals that photographs are always admixtures of fiction and reality tilted toward one end of the scale or the other. This survey of the ways in which photographers invent their images is not definitive or complete, but instead suggests the varieties of experience available to photography when the imaginary is pictured as if it were real. The selection also points toward photography's inherently promiscuous relationship with other mediums such as literature and film, not to mention its persuasive powers when used in advertising. The artists of our era, raised on the fictions of postwar consumer culture, use the assumed truthfulness of photography against itself to question how we think we know the world, the past, and ourselves. Leaving off at the end of the analog era, this survey brings the viewer to the precipice of a brave new world of digital manipulation that is bound to become ever more seamless to the naked eye."
2016,"Pattern, Color, Light","July 20, 2015–January 10, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/pattern-color-light,"This exhibition features examples of architectural ornament from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey that were found at sites ranging in date from approximately 500 to 1000. Few buildings from this period survive fully intact, but the pieces of walls, ceilings, and floors that remain shed light on the ingenious ways that artisans created sumptuous interiors and stately facades. Far from being mere embellishment, the decorative programs to which these pieces belonged were pivotal in creating memorable experiences for viewers, whether conveying the power of a patron or the depth of a religious concept. The presentation includes objects from the departments of Islamic Art , Ancient Near Eastern Art , and Medieval Art and The Cloisters , highlighting interconnections between works that are traditionally displayed apart. While the Near East witnessed significant social and political changes during the period from 500 to 1000, including the rise of Islam and the collapse of the Sasanian Empire, the objects on display attest to the persistence of certain artistic ideas across religious and political boundaries. These include the use of an established repertoire of vegetal and geometric patterns to enliven walls, the application of vibrant color schemes to architectural surfaces through polychrome painting and dyed textiles, and a fascination with bright, jewel-like materials such as polished marble and glass mosaic. These enduring aesthetic concepts, which informed architectural style for more than half a millennium, are explored further through the lens of the exhibition's three themes: pattern, color, and light. The exhibition is made possible by The Hagop Kevorkian Fund."
2016,Andrea del Sarto'sBorgherini Holy Family,"October 14, 2015–January 10, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/andrea-del-sarto-borgherini,"This focused exhibition presents new findings on the Metropolitan Museum's Holy Family with the Young Saint John the Baptist , one of the Museum's greatest works of the Italian Renaissance. The Metropolitan's painting is shown alongside Charity (before 1530), a closely related panel on loan from the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. The exhibition allows visitors to follow the artist's approach as he moved from drawings on paper to the preparatory underdrawings on the panels, and then to the final paintings, emphasizing the crucial role of drawings and cartoons in his workshop. The exhibition will complement Andrea del Sarto: The Renaissance Workshop in Action , a more extensive survey of the artist's work on view at The Frick Collection at the same time. Andrea del Sarto (1486–1530) was one of the most influential artists active in Florence in the first decades of the sixteenth century. He painted the grand Holy Family with the Young Saint John the Baptist around 1528 for Giovanni Borgherini, who was prominent during the city's tumultuous, short-lived Republic, before the Medici family reestablished its rule. The imagery of Christ sharing the orb with his cousin Saint John the Baptist, Florence's patron saint, was symbolic for the Republican government. Recent technical examination and conservation of the painting have revealed the masterful underdrawing of the figures and the brilliant, sumptuous color that led Sarto to be known as ""the painter without defects."" The exhibition examines Sarto's decision to adapt this composition for the related panel Charity , which was likely meant as an important gift for Francis I, the French king.

2016,Fashion and Virtue,"October 20, 2015–January 10, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/fashion-and-virtue,"Printed sources related to the design of textile patterns first appeared during the Renaissance. Six intricate interlaced designs, attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and later copied by Albrecht Dürer, stood at the beginning of a fruitful international exchange of pattern designs through print. From the 1520s, small booklets with textile patterns were published regularly. These pocket-sized, easy-to-use publications became an instant success and essentially formed the first fashion publications. This interdisciplinary exhibition, drawn largely from the Metropolitan Museum's own collection, combines printed pattern books, drawings, textile samples, costumes, paintings, and various other works of art to evoke the colorful world in which the Renaissance textile pattern books first emerged and functioned.

Because of their sensitivity to light, these works cannot be on permanent exhibition; each installation remains on view for approximately thirteen weeks. The rotations of the gallery consist of diverse pieces—new acquisitions as well as works that might not find their way into a major exhibition. They are selected to show the breadth and quality of the Museum's holdings, ranging from the Renaissance to the present. Highlights from this rotation include academic figure drawings from the sixteenth through the twentieth century; a large-scale cartoon by Domenichino (Italian, 1581–1641); etchings by the nineteenth-century Spanish artist Mariano Fortuny; Renaissance and Baroque prints bequeathed by Phyllis Massar in 2011; figure studies and lithographs by John Singer Sargent (American, 1856–1925); and prints by American artists Frank Lobdell (1921–2013), Richard Tuttle (born 1941), James Siena (born 1957), and Thomas Nozkowski (born 1944)."

2016,Kongo: Power and Majesty,"September 18, 2015–January 3, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/kongo,"Central Africa's Kongo civilization is responsible for one of the world's greatest artistic traditions. This international loan exhibition explores the region's history and culture through 146 of the most inspired creations of Kongo masters from the late fifteenth through the early twentieth century. The earliest of these creations were diplomatic missives sent by Kongo sovereigns to their European counterparts during the Age of Exploration; they took the form of delicately carved ivories and finely woven raffia cloths embellished with abstract geometric patterns. Admired as marvels of human ingenuity, such Kongo works were preserved in princely European Kunstkammer , or cabinets of curiosities, alongside other precious and exotic creations from across the globe. With works drawn from sixty institutional and private lenders across Europe and the United States, Kongo: Power and Majesty relates the objects on view to specific historical developments and challenges misconceptions of Africa's relationship with the West. In doing so, it offers a radical, new understanding of Kongo art over the last five hundred years. #KongoPower Featured Media ""… splendid, thought-provoking exhibition""— Wall Street Journal ""This rigorous and unshowily erudite exhibition … is that rarest thing: a scholarly blockbuster.""— The Guardian ""Curator Alisa LaGamma … has fused aesthetics, history, ethnography and spectacle into an exhibition that is at once entertaining and serious, shocking and deeply satisfying.""— Financial Times The exhibition is made possible by the Gail and Parker Gilbert Fund and the Diane W. and James E.

2016,In and Out of the Studio,"August 31, 2015–January 3, 2016",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/in-and-out-of-the-studio,"This exhibition presents one hundred years of portrait photography in West Africa through nearly eighty photographs taken between the 1870s and the 1970s. These works, many of which are being shown for the first time, are drawn from the Metropolitan Museum's Visual Resource Archives in the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas , with additions from the Department of Photographs . The installation seeks to expand our understanding of West African portrait photography by rendering the broad variety of these practices and aesthetics. It juxtaposes photographs, postcards, real photo postcards, and original negatives taken both inside and outside the studio by amateur and professional photographers active from Senegal to Cameroon and from Mali to Gabon. Among them are renowned artists such as Seydou Keïta, J. D. 'Okhai Ojeikere, and Samuel Fosso, as well as lesser-known practitioners who worked at the beginning of the century, including George A. G. Lutterodt, the Lisk-Carew Brothers, and Alex A. Acolatse. These photographers explored the possibilities of their medium, developing a rich aesthetic vocabulary through compelling self-portraits, staged images against painted backdrops or open landscapes, and casual snapshots of leisurely times. Regardless of their unique place in the history of photography in West Africa—from the formality of the earlier studio poses to the theatricality of Fosso's fantasies—the sitter's self-assured and unabashed presence fully engages the viewer. Photography allowed artists and patrons alike to express their articulation of what modernity looked like—one that was constantly reinvented."

To highlight the ongoing development of the collection's multicultural and interdisciplinary nature, this exhibition focuses on approximately forty works from Europe, the United States, Japan, India, and Tibet acquired between 2003 and 2014. Beyond the well-established categories of finely decorated armor, edged weapons, and firearms, the selection features drawings and prints, textiles, and other materials that are vital, but often unrecognized, aspects of the understanding and appreciation of arms and armor as a universal art form. Works on paper, textiles, and other select pieces will be rotated two to three times during the course of the exhibition."
2017,Relative Values: The Cost of Art in the Northern Renaissance,"August 7, 2017–January 23, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/relative-values-northern-renaissance,"Bringing together sixty-two masterpieces of sixteenth-century northern European art from The Met collection and one important loan, this exhibition revolves around questions of historical worth, exploring relative value systems in the Renaissance era. Organized in six sections—raw materials, virtuosity, technological advances, fame, market, and paragone—tapestry, stained and vessel glass, sculpture, paintings, precious metal-work, and enamels are juxtaposed with pricing data from sixteenth-century documents. What did a tapestry cost in the sixteenth century? Goldsmiths' work? Stained glass? How did variables like raw materials, work hours, levels of expertise and artistry, geography, and rarity, affect this? Did production cost necessarily align with perceived market valuation in inventoried collections? Who assigned these values? By exploring different sixteenth-century yardsticks of gauging worth, by probing extrinsic versus intrinsic value, and by presenting works of different media and function side-by-side, the exhibition captures a sense of the splendor and excitement of this era.

2017,Art and Peoples of the Kharga Oasis,"October 11, 2017–April 11, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/kharga-oasis,"In 1908, The Metropolitan Museum of Art began to excavate late-antique sites in the Kharga Oasis, located in Egypt's Western Desert. The Museum's archaeologists uncovered two-story houses, painted tombs, and a church. They also retrieved objects that reveal the multiple cultural and religious identities of the people who lived in the region. The finds represent a society between the third and seventh centuries A.D., a time of transition between the Roman and early Byzantine periods, which integrated Egyptian, Greek, and Roman culture and art. This exhibition features some thirty works from these excavations. By grouping objects according to the archaeological context in which they were discovered, the exhibition explores the interpretation of ancient identities and artifacts and shows how archaeological documentation can assist in understanding an object's original function. On view are ceramics, ostraca (pottery shards used as writing surfaces), jewelry from burials, glassware, coins, copies of frescoes with early Christian images, and early twentieth-century site photography.

2017,Streams and Mountains without End: Landscape Traditions of China,"August 26, 2017–August 4, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/streams-and-mountains,"From the standpoint of splendid scenery, painting cannot equal [real] landscape. But when it comes to the wonders of brush and ink, [real] landscape is no match for painting! —Dong Qichang (1555–1636) About a thousand years ago, the Chinese landscape painter Guo Xi posed the question, ""In what does a gentleman's love of landscape consist?"" This question is at the heart of the exhibition, which explores the many uses of landscape in the Chinese visual arts. This exhibition, which showcases more than 120 Chinese landscape paintings in four rotations, offers insights into the tradition, revealing distinctions between types of landscape that might not be obvious at first glance. What appears to be a simple mountain dwelling, for example, turns out to be the villa of the painter's friend, encoding a wish for his happy retirement. Similarly, what seems at first to be a simple study in dry brushwork turns out to be an homage to an old master, an expression of reverence for what has come before. Drawn primarily from The Met's holdings and supplemented by a dozen private loans, the presentation is augmented by decorative art objects with landscape themes.

Hired in 1962 by the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C., as a draftsman for a project on Precolumbian ceramics, he was promoted shortly thereafter to assistant curator responsible for carpets. In 1967, he joined the curatorial staff of the Cooper Hewitt Museum. Early in his career, Sonday began to put his artistic skills to use in creating legible and visually pleasing technical drawings that express the weaves of patterned textiles. He went on to teach seminars on fabric analysis, developing various methods that enabled students (even those who claimed they ""couldn't draw"") to re-create and therefore understand the structures of historical textiles. This installation includes a selection of Sonday's studies of lace structures and couched embroidery, loom models for patterned weaves, and diagrams made from classic handwoven textiles. His clear, comprehensible, and attractive drawings and models have become more than didactic tools. The wit and imagination evident in Sonday's choices of materials and colors and the skill with which the works are made has inspired delight and appreciation over the years. In 2012, Sonday donated his research archive to the Antonio Ratti Textile Center at The Met. The first portions are available for study now while the Museum continues cataloguing and processing this treasure trove. Sonday has generously given his time to assist with the ongoing organization of the archive, which spans his entire career and includes his most recent projects."

The objects are drawn exclusively from The Met collection, and some have not been on display for several decades. Among the works on view are two carved red-lacquer pieces from the early fifteenth century: dish with two birds and peonies has a lavish image treatment typical of the period; and sutra box with dragons amid clouds , which depicts a sinewy dragon, is representative of the elegant boxes produced for use both at the court and as diplomatic gifts, particularly to Tibet.

2017,Provocations: Anselm Kiefer at The Met Breuer,"December 13, 2017–April 8, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/anselm-kiefer,"Throughout his nearly fifty-year career, the German artist Anselm Kiefer (born 1945) has never been afraid to wrestle with the past. In 1969, toward the end of his studies at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe, he photographed himself in his father's Wehrmacht uniform, posing before historic monuments and Romantic seascapes in Europe with his arm extended in an illegal Nazi salute. Six years later, the artist selected eighteen of these images for a photo-essay titled ""Occupations,"" which met with widespread public outcry. Indeed, while Kiefer's artistic provocation ran counter to the intense process of postwar denazification, which included the destruction of offensive monuments and other symbols of Germany's infamous history, it was also a threat to a kind of collective amnesia that had overtaken West Germany in the 1960s and 1970s. In his continuing effort to disinter the past, in the 1980s Kiefer began to reuse old photographs for new projects and also extend his artistic means. He added new materials, such as earth, lead, and hay, and approached his works in near-alchemical ways. He also turned to monumental themes (including architecture, cosmology, and mysticism) to further ponder time and existence. While his ambition still grows in scale—today, his projects take over his nearly 400,000-square-foot studio outside Paris—his art, particularly in its worked and layered surfaces weathered by time and nature, remains a visceral and poetic consideration of the past as a means to understand our collective present and, by implication, our future. The works presented here, drawn from The Met collection, also offer us an opportunity to reflect on our own nation and the conflicted history we struggle to readdress today. The exhibition is made possible by Maria-Gaetana Matisse."

The exhibition includes dazzling portraits of well-known figures of his time: the American socialite Rita de Acosta Lydig; art patron and designer Count Étienne de Beaumont; aristocrat and society hostess Lady Ottoline Morrell; and celebrated entertainer Josephine Baker, among others. A highlight of the presentation is an exceptional book—one of only seven known copies—documenting Nijinsky's scandalous 1912 ballet L'Après-midi d'un faune . This rare album represents de Meyer's great success in capturing the movement and choreography of dance, a breakthrough in the history of photography.

2017,The Silver Caesars: A Renaissance Mystery,"December 12, 2017–March 12, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/silver-caesars,"This exhibition is dedicated to the extraordinary set of twelve silver-gilt standing cups known collectively as the Aldobrandini Tazze. The tazze are reunited and displayed together for the first time since the mid-nineteenth century, when the objects were disassembled and dispersed, their constituent parts misidentified and mismatched. The exhibition thus provides visitors with a rare opportunity to appreciate one of the finest and most enigmatic monuments of sixteenth-century goldsmiths' work. Properly reassembled, the tazze bring to life the history of the first twelve Caesars, as recounted by the Roman historian Suetonius. Each stands over a foot high and is composed of a shallow footed dish surmounted by the figure of one of the Caesars; four scenes from Suetonius's Life of the relevant ruler appear intricately wrought upon the concave interior of each dish. The Silver Caesars highlights the elegance and erudition of the tazze, presenting them together with a small selection of relevant works in silver as well as in other media—including both ancient and Renaissance coins and medals, and Renaissance prints, books, and paintings. The exhibition also addresses the set's later history by presenting eighteenth- and nineteenth-century works that the tazze inspired. In addition to offering new insights into the tazze and their history, the exhibition also explores the set's famously mysterious reputation—engaging the visitor in tracing clues that may lead to a better understanding of this Renaissance masterpiece.

This major retrospective—the exhibition's only North American venue—honors the artist in his 80th year by presenting his most iconic works and key moments of his career from 1960 to the present. Working in a wide range of media with equal measures of wit and intelligence, Hockney has examined, probed, and questioned how to capture the perceived world of movement, space, and time in two dimensions. The exhibition offers a grand overview of the artist's achievements across all media, including painting, drawing, photography, and video. From his early experiments with modernist abstraction and mid-career experiments with illusion and realism, to his most recent, jewel-toned landscapes, Hockney has consistently explored the nature of perception and representation with both intellectual rigor and sheer delight in the act of looking. #Hockney Featured Media The Animals: Love Letters Between Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy Mickalene Thomas on David Hockney | Artists on Artworks ""Ravishing . . . a revelation"" — New Yorker ""Delightful, absorbing exhibition"" — New York Times ""One of the delights of the season"" — Washington Post The exhibition is made possible in part by The Horace W.

2017,Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer,"November 13, 2017–February 12, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/michelangelo,"Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), a towering genius in the history of Western art, is the subject of this once-in-a-lifetime exhibition. During his long life, Michelangelo was celebrated for the excellence of his disegno , the power of drawing and invention that provided the foundation for all the arts. For his mastery of drawing, design, sculpture, painting, and architecture, he was called Il Divino (""the divine one"") by his contemporaries. His powerful imagery and dazzling technical virtuosity transported viewers and imbued all of his works with a staggering force that continues to enthrall us today. This exhibition presents a stunning range and number of works by the artist: 133 of his drawings, three of his marble sculptures, his earliest painting, his wood architectural model for a chapel vault, as well as a substantial body of complementary works by other artists for comparison and context. Among the extraordinary international loans are the complete series of masterpiece drawings he created for his friend Tommaso de' Cavalieri and a monumental cartoon for his last fresco in the Vatican Palace. Selected from 50 public and private collections in the United States and Europe, the exhibition examines Michelangelo's rich legacy as a supreme draftsman and designer. #MetMichelangelo Accompanied by a catalogue by the organizing curator of the exhibition, Carmen C. Bambach—an authoritative volume that examines the Renaissance master as ""the divine draftsman and designer"" whose work, according to Giorgio Vasari, embodied the unity of the arts.

The wall compositions were designed for limited duration and maximum flexibility within a broad range of architectural settings. Initially executed by drafters, these works in their finished state were most often slated for destruction. A seminal practitioner of Conceptual Art, LeWitt emphasized the creative idea that generates a work of art, as opposed to the work's material existence. ""For each work of art that becomes physical,"" he wrote, ""there are many variations that do not.""

2017,"Delirious: Art at the Limits of Reason, 1950–1980","September 13, 2017–January 14, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/delirious,"Delirious times demand delirious art, or so this exhibition proposes. The years between 1950 and 1980 were beset by upheaval. Around the globe, military conflict proliferated and social and political unrest flared. Disenchantment with an oppressive rationalism mounted, as did a corollary interest in fantastic, hallucinatory experiences. Artists responded to these developments by incorporating absurdity, disorder, nonsense, disorientation, and repetition into their work. In the process, they destabilize space and perception, give form to extreme mental, emotional, and physical states, and derange otherwise logical structures and techniques. Delirious explores the embrace of irrationality among American, Latin American, and European artists. Divided into four sections—Vertigo, Excess, Nonsense, and Twisted—this exhibition showcases roughly 100 works of art by 62 artists, including Antonio Berni, Dara Birnbaum, Tony Conrad, Hanne Darboven, Dean Fleming, Nancy Grossman, Philip Guston, Eva Hesse, Alfred Jensen, Yayoi Kusama, Sol LeWitt, Darcílio Lima, Lee Lozano, Anna Maria Maiolino, Ana Mendieta, Bruce Nauman, Jim Nutt, Hélio Oiticica, Claes Oldenburg, Abraham Palatnik, Howardena Pindell, Peter Saul, Mira Schendel, Carolee Schneemann, Paul Sharits, Robert Smithson, Nancy Spero, Paul Thek, and Stan VanDerBeek. About a third of the exhibition is drawn from The Met collection. Linked by a common distrust of reason, the featured works alternately simulate and stimulate delirium, straining the limits of both legibility and intelligibility. Ultimately, the exhibition asks if it is possible to understand a good deal of postwar art, even seemingly rational art, as an exercise in calculated lunacy. #DeliriousMet #MetBreuer Featured Media Conversation on Delirious Art and Times ""Restless, daring show ... a nervy multimedia survey of postwar art."" — New York Times The catalogue is made possible by the Antoinette Kraushaar Fund and Marsha and Jeffrey Perelman.

2017,Modernism on the Ganges: Raghubir Singh Photographs,"October 11, 2017–January 2, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/raghubir-singh-photographs,"Raghubir Singh (1942–1999) was a pioneer of color street photography who worked and published prolifically from the late 1960s until his death in 1999 at age 56. Born into an aristocratic family in Rajasthan, he lived in Hong Kong, Paris, London, and New York—but his eye was perpetually drawn back to his native India. This retrospective exhibition situates Singh's photographic work at the intersection of Western modernism and traditional South Asian modes of picturing the world. It features 85 photographs by Singh in counterpoint with works by his contemporaries—friends, collaborators, fellow travelers—as well as examples of the Indian court painting styles that inspired him. The exhibition traces the full trajectory of Singh's career from his early work as a photojournalist in the late 1960s through his last unpublished projects of the late 1990s. Using a handheld camera and color slide film, he recorded India's dense milieu in complex frieze-like compositions teeming with incident, fractured by reflections, and pulsating with opulent color. Singh embraced color as part of a continuous Indian aesthetic tradition that reaches back to the miniature paintings of the Mughal period. He was also deeply influenced by the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson (whom he met in Jaipur in 1966), Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray, and American street photographers such as William Gedney and Lee Friedlander. As he traveled along his own artistic path, Singh forged a distinctively Indian style of modernist photography that stands, as he put it, ""on the Ganges side of modernism."" #RaghubirSingh Featured Media Performance The exhibition is made possible by Nita and Mukesh Ambani and the Reliance Foundation.

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of over 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1962 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the 19th century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

Many became active patrons of the arts, giving rise to the so-called Company School of painting—or simply Company painting—of the 18th and 19th centuries. Responding to their patrons' European tastes, scientific interests, and sense of discovery, Indian artists—some previously trained in late-Mughal techniques of painting—evolved their styles to create large-scale images of India's flora, fauna, people, and landscape. While formal natural studies comprise a major genre of Company painting, other idioms, such as the picturesque—which offered romanticized views of landscape and architecture—also flourished. This exhibition brings together works from The Met collection that have never before been shown together and features the debut of two recent acquisitions. This exhibition was also on view from July 19 through September 16, 2016."
2017,Talking Pictures: Camera-Phone Conversations Between Artists,"June 27–December 17, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/talking-pictures,"Over the past decade, mobile-phone cameras have changed how photographs are made, used, and looked at. While the camera once functioned chiefly as a tool for preserving the past, today people use mobile phones to share their visual experience in real time and with unprecedented intimacy. This exhibition explores what happens when artists are partnered with other artists and the pairs engage in a visual dialogue using only their phones. The Met commissioned 12 artists to participate in the project, all of whom were asked to invite another artist to be his or her conversation partner for a five-month period. From November 2016 to April 2017, the participants sent still images and brief videos back and forth in a game of pictorial ping-pong. They were asked not to write messages or captions and to refrain from sharing their images on social media. Otherwise, the content and frequency of communication was determined by the artists themselves. Highlights of the exhibition include a conversation between Manjari Sharma and Irina Rozovsky, who discovered they were both pregnant and due in April (their conversation ended with images of their newborns); a comical back-and-forth of videos between William Wegman and Tony Oursler; an exchange of photographs of paintings created especially for this project by Cynthia Daignault and Daniel Heidkamp; and a witty dialogue about feminism and political resistance between Nicole Eisenman and A. L. Steiner.

Vairochana, the emanation of the historic Buddha Shakyamuni, sat at the center of the cosmos, while each of the Pure Lands in the four cardinal directions was presided over by a celestial Buddha. The vast and complex Mahayana and tantric pantheon of Buddhist gods and goddesses are emanations of these living Buddhas, while individual deities associated with them personify ideas such as compassion, abundance, learning, or protection. This cosmic organization gave a popular goddess like the savior Tara a clear place within the Buddhist pantheon. At the same time, an advanced tantric practitioner could find a powerful esoteric deity, such as Hevajra, conceptualized in an unambiguous context. This exhibition draws together works of the highest caliber and places Vairochana at the center of the gallery, and the directional cosmic Buddhas on the four walls along with some of their most significant manifestations, presenting this complex Buddhist pantheon of deities in a startlingly simple way.

2017,The Aesthetic Movement in America,"July 13, 2016–December 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/aesthetic-movement,"This installation highlights a great strength of The Met collection—arts of the late 19th-century Anglo-American Aesthetic movement. Featuring a range of art furniture, ceramics, stained glass, metalwork, textiles, painting, and sculpture—most from the Museum's permanent holdings and a few select loans—the display explores Aestheticism as a cultural phenomenon of its time that promoted beauty as an artistic, social, and moral force, particularly in the domestic realm. The catalyst for the phenomenon's widespread popularity in the United States was the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition, held in Philadelphia, and Aestheticism remained a driving force through the late 1880s, especially in New York. The period witnessed the flourishing of an artistic culture and lifestyle movement that also encompassed painting, sculpture, and works on paper; the proliferation of art publications, clubs, and societies; an intense interest in collecting and decoration; and the founding of the nation's major art museums. Aesthetic furnishings and objects were intended for fully integrated domestic spaces—as seen, for example, in The Met's latest historical interior, the Worsham-Rockefeller Dressing Room, on view nearby—and reveal the progressive tastes and collaborative spirit of the era."

This exhibition represents Berman's life from 1982 to 2004, when she lived by herself in a small apartment in Greenwich Village. In her closet Berman lovingly organized her shoes, clothes, linens, beauty products, luggage, and other necessities. Although the clothing is of various tints—including cream, ivory, and ecru—it gives the impression of being all white. With its neatly arranged stacks of starched and precisely folded clothing, the closet is presented as a small period room in dialogue with The Met's recently installed Worsham-Rockefeller Dressing Room from 1882, which features clothing from the 1880s of the type that Arabella Worsham, a wealthy art patroness, might have worn. Despite vast differences of scale and ornament, and the separation of 100 years, the two rooms show there were similarities between the life stories of Berman and Worsham (c. 1850–1924). Both began as women of limited means who, by their own ingenuity, created new lives for themselves in New York. The exhibition was originally organized and exhibited at Mmuseumm in New York City in 2015. #SaraBermansCloset Featured Media Inside Sara Berman's Closet The exhibition is made possible by the Frank and Eva Buck Foundation."
2017,Drawings and Prints: Selections from The Met Collection,"August 8–November 20, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/drawings-and-prints-august-rotation,"The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr., Gallery displays highlights of European and American prints, drawings, and illustrated books from the Museum's vast holdings of works on paper. Because of their sensitivity to light, these works cannot be on permanent exhibition; each installation remains on view for approximately 13 weeks. The rotations of the gallery consist of diverse pieces—new acquisitions as well as works that might not find their way into a major exhibition. They are selected to show the breadth and quality of the Museum's holdings, ranging from the Renaissance to the present. Highlights from this rotation include a selection of architectural models from the 16th through the 20th century; representations of childhood in French works on paper from the second half of the 18th century; a selection of prints by 16th-century Italian artists who experimented with printing in color; drawings and prints of mountain landscapes; a group of works on paper that celebrate the bounty of Holland in the early 17th century; prints to which changes have been made by hand; Work Projects Administration (WPA) prints by African-American artists of the 1930s and '40s; and works on paper picturing subway commuters.

2017,Eighteenth-Century Pastel Portraits,"July 26–November 5, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/pastel-portraits,"Pastel portraiture flourished in 18th-century Europe owing to the medium's distinctive optical properties—its brilliant colors and warm glow. The powdery nature of pastel crayons allowed artists to bathe their sitters in flattering light. The dual nature of the paintings—realistic yet ephemeral—inspired in viewers a sense of wonder. This exhibition draws from a small but important group of French, Italian, German, and British pastels in the Museum's collection. Examining works by Rosalba Carriera, Charles Antoine Coypel, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, and other leading portraitists, it explores the rising popularity of pastel in conjunction with artistic practices and technological advances of the day.

Featuring detailed replicas of nearly 100 objects from The Met collection, The Theater of Disappearance encompasses thousands of years of artistic production over several continents and cultures, and fuses them with facsimiles of contemporary human figures as well as furniture, animals, cutlery, and food. Each object—whether a 1,000-year-old decorative plate or a human hand—is rendered in the same black or white material and coated in a thin layer of dust. The artist has reconfigured the environment of the Cantor Roof by adding a new pergola, a grand tiled floor, a bar, public benches and augmented planting throughout the space. The Met's own alphabet has even been incorporated into the graphic identity of the project. To realize this extensive work, the artist immersed himself in the Museum and its staff for many months, holding conversations with the curators, conservators, managers, and technicians across every department who contributed to the realization of this installation.

This exhibition features his earliest masterpiece, a monumental painting showing two scenes—Moses and the brazen serpent, and the Transfiguration of Jesus—in an unprecedented juxtaposition of these Old and New Testament subjects. Painted in 1683 for a chapel in Puebla Cathedral and newly conserved, the 28-foot-tall painting has never before been exhibited outside its place of origin in Puebla, Mexico. Ten additional works are shown that demonstrate Villalpando's engagement with concepts of invention and professional identity, his ability to convey complex subject matter, and his capacity to envision the divine. Highlights include his recently discovered Adoration of the Magi , on loan from Fordham University, and The Holy Name of Mary , from the Museum of the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City. #Villalpando Featured Media Conservation ""The outstanding altarpiece ... should be a pilgrimage site of its own this summer."" — New York Times ""Stunning"" — Wall Street Journal The exhibition is organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Fomento Cultural Banamex, A.C.

It was not until the Qing dynasty, however, that an abundant supply of raw material, extraordinary craftsmanship, and keen imperial patronage allowed the art to flourish. During the 18th century, widespread prosperity and successful military campaigns brought political stability, while also securing the trade routes that permitted the importation of gemstones over the Silk Roads and through sea trade routes from as far away as Europe. Showcasing a selection of 75 exquisite carvings drawn from The Met collection, this exhibition presents the lapidary art of China's Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Featuring not only jade, the most esteemed of East Asian gems, but also agate, malachite, turquoise, quartz, amber, coral, and lapis lazuli, the exhibition reveals the extensive variety of hardstones and full palette of vibrant colors that were favored at the imperial court. Exploring the diverse subjects and styles of Qing lapidary art, Colors of the Universe illustrates the extraordinary imagination and technical virtuosity behind these miniature sculptures. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2017,From the Imperial Theater,"June 25, 2016–October 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/from-the-imperial-theater,"Drawn entirely from The Met collection, this exhibition examines these luxury textiles from artistic and technical points of view. It is organized in two rotations: The first focuses on costumes used in dramas based on historical events; and the second features costumes from plays derived from legends and myths. The presentation showcases eight robes, each of which was created for a specific role—court lady, official, general, monk, nun, and immortal. A set of album leaves faithfully depicting theatrical characters wearing such robes is also displayed. The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed a flowering of Chinese drama. Under the patronage of the Qing court (1644–1911), performances—including the ""Peking Opera""—filled the Forbidden City in Beijing. A form of traditional Chinese theater, Peking Opera was developed fully by the mid-19th century, and because of the form's minimal stage settings and the importance of exaggerated gestures and movements, costume played an unusually significant role. This exhibition includes superb examples with interior markings indicating their use in court productions. #ChineseOperaCostumes The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2017,Cinnabar,"June 25, 2016–October 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/cinnabar,"This exhibition, featuring 45 magnificent examples of Chinese carved lacquer drawn entirely from The Met collection, will explore the development of this significant artistic tradition. Among the objects on view will be works created as birthday gifts bearing symbols of long life, such as peaches, cranes, the character for longevity (shou), and representations of children. One of the highlights is a unique, large, lobed tray of the 14th century, carved with a delightful scene showing two women and 33 children. Other early pieces on view include a dish with a scene of long-tailed birds and hollyhocks. A rare screen that was produced by Lu Guisheng—a famous 19th-century artist and one of the few individuals working in lacquer whose name is recorded in Chinese history—provides a spectacular finale to this tradition. Lacquer, the resin of a family of trees found in southern China, hardens when exposed to oxygen and humidity and can become a natural plastic. Tinted with cinnabar (red), carbon (black), and other minerals, it has been used as an artistic medium in China since at least the sixth century B.C. Carved lacquer, which involves applying multiple layers of lacquer onto a substructure (usually wood) and then entails carving through the layers, is the most laborious and time-consuming of all lacquering techniques. #ChineseLacquer The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

This exhibition reevaluates Sottsass's career in a presentation of key works in a range of media—including architectural drawings, interiors, furniture, machines, ceramics, glass, jewelry, textiles and pattern, painting, and photography. The exhibition presents Sottsass's work in dialogue with ancient and contemporaneous objects that inspired him, as well as his influence on designers working today. These juxtapositions offer new insight into his designs, situating him within a broader design discourse that reveals him as a true design radical. #Sottsass #MetBreuer Featured Media ""... an invigorating, illuminating experience."" — New York Times"

This exhibition—drawn entirely from The Met collection—compares foliate patterns and roundels that are found on textiles from the Late Roman, Byzantine, and Early Islamic periods in Egypt to similar motifs in postcards by the Wiener Werkstätte and on garments designed by Mariano Fortuny (1871–1949). Created in Egypt between about 200 and 600, the textiles on view include a child's dress; fragments from a sleeve, tunic, and blanket or cover; and other fragments whose original use is not known. Variations of the scrolling vines and stylized motifs that adorn these textiles can be seen on works created nearly 1500 years later. The renowned Spanish-born designer Mariano Fortuny was active in Venice, where he founded a textile workshop and commercial silk printing factory. His exquisite designs fuse the ancient and the modern, the local and the exotic. Three different Fortuny-designed silk coats from the first three decades of the 20th century are shown over the course of the exhibition. In cut and ornament, these items harken back to Late Antique historical sources. Founded in 1903 in reaction both to the neoclassical academies of Vienna and increasing industrialization, the Wiener Werkstätte collective sought to incorporate arts and crafts into all aspects of daily life and placed a premium on the handmade. Eight color lithographs created between 1907 and 1912 by various artists and designers affiliated with the group are also on view. Motifs similar to those found on Late Antique textiles were used as graphic elements in these cards and postcards."
2017,The Secret Life of Textiles: Synthetic Materials,"March 6–September 25, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/secret-life-of-textiles-synthetic,"The 20th century saw unprecedented use of synthetic materials in all aspects of life. Fashion designers in particular were drawn to modern plastics for their unusual appearance and superior performance. Due to their unstable composition, however, these types of materials have shorter lifespans than natural fibers; some actually self-destruct. This exhibition, the third in a series at The Met focused on textile materials, features more than 40 ensembles and accessories from The Costume Institute's collection, along with a special section that illustrates the typical deterioration process of plastics that have been integrated into historic fashions, emphasizing the material's problematic behavior. Analytical images accompany selected objects, highlighting their physical properties."

The thematic show features approximately 140 examples of Kawakubo's womenswear for Comme des Garçons dating from the early 1980s to her most recent collection, many with heads and wigs created and styled by Julien d'Ys. The galleries illustrate the designer's revolutionary experiments in ""in-betweenness""—the space between boundaries. Objects are organized into nine aesthetic expressions of interstitiality in Kawakubo's work: Absence/Presence, Design/Not Design, Fashion/Anti-Fashion, Model/Multiple, Then/Now, High/Low, Self/Other, Object/Subject, and Clothes/Not Clothes.

Calling it ""Mexican maiolica,"" she highlighted its importance as a North American artistic achievement. De Forest was the daughter of the Museum's first president and, with her husband, Robert, a founder of The American Wing. The De Forests envisioned building a collection of Mexican art, and, even though their ambitions were frustrated at the time, the foundational gift of more than one hundred pieces of pottery anchors The Met's holdings. Today, more than a century later, their vision resonates as the Museum commits to collecting and exhibiting not just the arts of Mexico, but all of Latin America. This exhibition highlights the early contributions of the De Forests and others, and presents recent additions to the collection for the first time."

Alternately provocative, poignant, and absurdist, all of them explore the relationships among power, performance, and moving images. Here, the role of the camera is paramount. Besides a mediating agent and a framing device, the camera also serves as a witness, representing acts of injustice as well as moments of rebellion. The exhibition title functions in two ways. Historically, ""body politic"" has been used to describe a community comprising disparate individuals. According to this analogy, responsibility for the overall health of the body politic is shared equally among citizens, just as the fate of any one part has ramifications for the whole. Today, the phrase connotes more generally the politics of the body—that is, the way individual bodies not only suffer political violence but also wield political authority, especially as it has bearing on their race, ethnicity, class, and gender. Each of these meanings is relevant to the works featured in The Body Politic . #MetBodyPolitic Related Programming Concurrent with The Body Politic is an eight-week summer series called Theater of the Resist .

2017,Paradise of Exiles: Early Photography in Italy,"March 13–August 13, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/paradise-of-exiles,"Deemed a ""Paradise of Exiles"" by the British poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, Italy attracted not only 19th-century Romantics, but also many of photography's earliest practitioners, who traveled to the peninsula in order to capture its monuments and distinctive topography. At the same time, Italians adopted daguerreotypes and paper negatives as a means to represent their own cultural patrimony during a period of political upheaval. This exhibition focuses on Italy's importance as a center of exchange and experimentation during the first three decades of photography's history—from 1839, the year of its invention, to 1871, the year Italy became a unified nation. Paradise of Exiles highlights the little-known contribution of Italian photographers to the development of the new medium through some 35 photographs and albums drawn from The Met collection, along with 11 loans, including rare daguerreotypes and photographs related to the Risorgimento, the period of modern Italian unification. #ParadiseofExiles Related Content Read a Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History essay, "" The Rise of Paper Photography in Italy, 1839–55 ,"" written by exhibition curator Beth Saunders.

2017,Simple Gifts: Shaker at The Met,"July 13, 2016–August 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/simple-gifts,"The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing—also known as the Shakers—is a utopian religious sect that rose to prominence in America in the 19th century. The Shakers distinguished themselves from mainstream American culture by establishing communities centered on the equality of the sexes, collective property, pacifism, and industry. This installation features more than two dozen works from The Met's permanent collection, including furniture, textiles, and tools, that reflect the Shakers' life and art. These objects embody the Shakers' characteristic, minimalist designs and careful craftsmanship, both of which strongly influenced 19th-century counterparts in the external world as well as 20th- and 21st-century modern artists, performers, collectors, and museums. From the 1930s to '60s, collectors Faith and Edward Andrews cultivated relationships with surviving Shaker groups in New York and New England and accumulated the most comprehensive collection of furniture, textiles, and archival objects from the Believers. In 1966, The Met acquired numerous works from the Andrewses' collection, several of which are on view in this installation. In addition, Shaker artifacts are grouped near paintings by artist Charles Sheeler (1883–1965) and a video projection of Martha Graham's modern dance Appalachian Spring , which was performed on a stage set designed by Isamu Noguchi and choreographed to Aaron Copland's timeless musical score. The blending of historic and modern artwork in this installation provides a compelling narrative on the legacy of Shaker design from the 19th through the 21st century."
2017,Show and Tell,"October 29, 2016–August 6, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/show-and-tell,"In China, paintings that tell stories serve as powerful vehicles to promote political agendas, endorse cultural values, or express personal thoughts. With masterpieces dating from the fourth century, narrative is the earliest established genre in Chinese painting. This exhibition is the first at The Met to explore the various ways in which Chinese artists have gone beyond mere illustration to convey multiple layers of meaning. Displaying works from the 12th century to the present, this exhibition introduces three distinct modes of pictorial storytelling: multipart illustrations presented in long handscrolls, often punctuated with passages of text; single iconic scenes that evoke an entire story; and generic landscapes or flower-and-bird paintings that acquire narrative significance through the artist's inscription. The exhibition is further organized by theme: historical events, seasonal progression, warfare, journeys, Buddhist and Confucian values, and family and friendship. One special gallery focuses on a grandiose military narrative—that of China's annexation of East Turkestan in the 1750s. The installation, a collaboration among three Museum departments, features a suite of European engravings alongside Chinese weaponry and a painting to show how an emperor exploited art for his own aggrandizement. Contemporary Chinese artists have continued the narrative tradition with an expanded repertoire of subjects and approaches. The examples on display range from reflections on the creative process to critiques of modern technology and government policies. Together, the approximately 60 pictorial works and 30 decorative art objects, most from The Met collection, present a comprehensive view of the narrative genre, demonstrating its expressive versatility and continuing relevance. #ChinesePainting  The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

The first Asian works of art to enter the collection—mostly ceramics and lacquers—were acquired in 1879 and originally accommodated in what was then called the Department of Decorative Arts. Only in 1915 was a separate Department of Far Eastern Art established, and it was not until 1986 that its name was changed to the Department of Asian Art. The timeline presented in the photographs in this exhibition chronicles the changing face of The Met's galleries of Asian art as the building's footprint has expanded, exhibition styles have evolved, and the collection has grown. Forever a work in progress, The Met's collection of Asian art is ultimately the product of the passion and scholarship of the many collectors, curators, donors, dealers, and directors who have together shaped the Museum's holdings and legacy. #AsianArt100"

2017,Lygia Pape: A Multitude of Forms,"March 21–July 23, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/lygia-pape,"Lygia Pape: A Multitude of Forms is the first monographic exhibition in the United States devoted to Brazilian artist Lygia Pape (1927–2004). A critical figure in the development of Brazilian modern art, Pape combined geometric abstraction with notions of body, time, and space in unique ways that radically transformed the nature of the art object in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Covering a prolific, unclassifiable career that spanned five decades, this exhibition examines Pape's extraordinarily rich oeuvre as manifest across varied media—from sculpture, prints, and painting to installation, photography, performance, and film. #LygiaPape #MetBreuer Featured Media The exhibition is made possible by The Daniel and Estrellita Brodsky Foundation and The Garcia Family Foundation.

Synthesizing new archaeological discoveries with in-depth research performed over the last 50 years, Age of Empires introduces a transformational era of Chinese civilization to a global audience. The works in the exhibition—extremely rare ceramics, metalwork, textiles, sculpture, painting, calligraphy, and architectural models—are drawn exclusively from 32 museums and archaeological institutions in the People's Republic of China, and a majority of the works have never before been seen in the West. Highlights include renowned terracotta army warriors and a striking statue of a seminude performer whose anatomical accuracy, unheard of in Chinese art, brings to mind Greco-Roman sculpture first introduced to Asia by Alexander the Great. #MetAgeofEmpires Featured Media The exhibition is made possible by Additional support is provided by the Joseph Hotung Fund, the Ing Foundation, the Henry Luce Foundation, Agnes Hsu-Tang and Oscar L.

2017,Peder Balke: Painter of Northern Light,"April 10–July 10, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/peder-balke,"The Norwegian landscape and marine painter Peder Balke (1804–1887) merged the Romantic movement's spiritual vein of naturalism with an expressiveness rarely equaled by his contemporaries. Born in humble circumstances in what was then a northern hinterland, Balke trained as an artisan before pursuing his aim to become an artist in the broader European tradition, which led to formative contacts with Caspar David Friedrich and Johan Christian Dahl. From the 1840s onward, Balke searched for ever more personal means to convey the wild beauty of Norway, producing dramatic, even hallucinatory paintings that reject conventional fine-art techniques in favor of radical simplifications of form and color. Balke seems to have ceased painting after the 1870s, and he was essentially forgotten until the 20th century. In recent years, however, he has been rediscovered by artists, collectors, and scholars alike. This exhibition is the first in the United States to focus on this strikingly singular, visionary painter. It brings together 17 paintings by Balke borrowed from private collections, presented in context with paintings by his compatriots drawn from The Met collection. This is a unique opportunity to explore the work of an artist who focused on those aspects of art and nature that inspire awe known as the Sublime."
2017,Caravaggio's Last Two Paintings,"April 11–July 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/caravaggio,"The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula , Caravaggio's (1571–1610) last painting, is on exceptional loan from the Banca Intesa Sanpaolo in Naples and presented with The Met's The Denial of Saint Peter , also created by the artist in the last months of his life. Commissioned by the Genoese patrician Marcantonio Doria two months before the artist's death in July 1610, Caravaggio painted The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula in an unprecedented minimalist style; its interpretation of the tragic event that is its subject, combined with the abbreviated manner of painting, has only one parallel: The Denial of Saint Peter . These two extraordinary paintings have not been reunited since a 2004 exhibition in London and Naples devoted to Caravaggio's late work. Since then, there has been a great deal of information discovered about Caravaggio's last years. This exhibition offers a rare opportunity to see these two pictures side by side and to examine the novelty of Caravaggio's late style, in which the emphasis is less on the naturalistic depiction of the figures than on their psychological presence. In these two works, Caravaggio poignantly probes a dark world burdened by guilt and doom, suggesting to some scholars an intersection with his biography and his sense of the tragedy of life. This exhibition was made possible by the Banca Intesa Sanpaolo through its internal Culture Program. Additional support was provided by the Foundation for Italian Art and Culture (FIAC)."
2017,Renaissance Maiolica,"October 20, 2016–July 9, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/renaissance-maiolica,"This exhibition of Renaissance maiolica, drawn exclusively from The Met's world-renowned collection, celebrates the publication of Maiolica, Italian Renaissance Ceramics in The Metropolitan Museum of Art by Timothy Wilson. As Wilson writes, ""Painted pottery, at its most ambitious, is a serious form of Italian Renaissance art, with much to offer those interested in the wider culture of this astoundingly creative period."" This creativity was applied to a vast range of practical objects. The exhibition includes tableware and serving vessels, desk ornaments, storage containers, devotional objects, as well as sculpture, all made in painted and tin-glazed earthenware. The maiolica tradition flourished from the 15th to the 17th century. Italian potters transformed techniques they owed to the Islamic world into something entirely unprecedented, and in turn laid the foundations for similar pottery traditions across Europe. Potters and pottery painters exploited innovations of the Renaissance goldsmith, sculptor, and painter in what was a relatively humble medium. That it was owned by the social elite of Italy, however, testifies to its artistic value. This exhibition explores how the different functions of Renaissance maiolica dictated the ways painted pottery was seen and decorated. Groups of objects are installed in displays suggestive of their use. An assembly of storage jars give a sense of a pharmacy's shelves. Among the tableware on display are istoriato plates and dishes—their surfaces covered with scenes from mythology and ancient history—from some of the most important services commissioned by leading Italian families. The exhibition also shows maiolica-makers using ceramic, paint, and glaze to compete with other art forms, including a Madonna and Child that imitates a framed panel painting and a Lamentation group that likely once functioned as a sculpted altarpiece, the largest known example of sculptural maiolica to survive. The publication is made possible by The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Friends of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, The Peter Jay Sharp Foundation, Marica and Jan Vilcek, and Ceramica-Stiftung Basel."
2017,Celebrating the Year of the Rooster,"January 25–July 4, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/year-of-the-rooster,"Each of the 12 animals in the zodiac corresponds to a year in a repeating 12-year cycle that makes up the traditional East Asian lunar calendar. The association of these zodiac animals with the Chinese calendar first appeared in the third century B.C., and became firmly established by the first century. In sequence, the 12 animals are: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each animal is believed to embody certain traits that are personified by the character of the people born in that year. This Lunar New Year, beginning on January 29, is the Year of the Rooster. Since the rooster is an early riser, people born in the year of the rooster are thought to be diligent and industrious. Archaeological finds date the rooster's domestication to prehistoric times. The rooster is also one of the six animals ( liuchu ) recorded in the Chinese classics; the other five are the horse, ox, sheep, dog, and pig, each of which plays an essential role in the life of humans. According to Chinese legend, there is a heavenly rooster in the land of the immortals that lives in a peach tree on top of Taodu Mountain. It crows when the sun casts its first rays on the tree, thus awakening the whole world. The rooster is also an auspicious figure, because its crowing brings out the sun and dispels the darkness. Consequently, roosters have been a popular motif in Chinese art since ancient times. A few choice examples from The Met collection are featured here."

Chappel (1801–1878), a tinsmith and amateur painter, depicted scenes of early 19th-century New York City. This exhibition features 27 small oil paintings from The Met collection that were probably executed late in the artist's life. Chappel's meticulously detailed images of street peddlers, artisan workshops, and swimmers cooling off in the East River—the kinds of commonplace scenes that were seldom documented—provide a rare glimpse of urban life 200 years ago.

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of over 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1962 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the 19th century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."
2017,Marsden Hartley's Maine,"March 15–June 18, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/marsden-hartley,"This exhibition explores Marsden Hartley's complex, sometimes contradictory, and visually arresting relationship with his native state—from the lush Post-Impressionist inland landscapes with which he launched his career, to the later roughly rendered paintings of Maine's rugged coastal terrain, its hardy inhabitants, and the magisterial Mount Katahdin. Hartley's renowned abstract German series, New Mexico recollections, and Nova Scotia period have been celebrated in previous exhibitions, but Marsden Hartley's Maine illuminates Maine as a critical factor in understanding the artist's high place in American art history. Maine served as an essential slate upon which he pursued new ideas and theories. It was a lifelong source of inspiration intertwined with his personal history, cultural milieu, and desire to create a regional expression of American modernism. In keeping with The Met Breuer's mission to present modern art in the context of the history of art, this exhibition includes select works from The Met collection by other artists who shaped Hartley's vision, including French modernist Paul Cézanne, Japanese printmakers Utagawa Hiroshige and Katsushika Hokusai, and American painters Winslow Homer and Albert Pinkham Ryder. Marsden Hartley's Maine is co-organized with the Colby College Museum of Art, where the exhibition will be featured from July 8 through November 12, 2017. #MarsdenHartley #MetBreuer Featured Media The exhibition is made possible by the Barrie A. and Deedee Wigmore Foundation, the Henry Luce Foundation, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, and the Jane and Robert Carroll Fund.

2017,Seurat's Circus Sideshow,"February 17–May 29, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/seurat-circus-sideshow,"Taking as its focus one of The Met's most captivating masterpieces, this thematic exhibition affords a unique context for appreciating the heritage and allure of Circus Sideshow (Parade de cirque) , painted in 1887–88 by Georges Seurat (1859–1891). Anchored by a remarkable group of related works by Seurat that fully illuminates the lineage of the motif in his inimitable conté crayon drawings, the presentation explores the fascination the sideshow subject held for other artists in the nineteenth century, ranging from the great caricaturist Honoré Daumier at mid-century to the young Pablo Picasso at the fin de siècle. This rich visual narrative unfolds in a provocative display of more than 100 paintings, drawings, prints, period posters, and illustrated journals, supplemented by musical instruments and an array of documentary material intended to give a vivid sense of the seasonal fairs and traveling circuses of the day. Among the highlights is Fernand Pelez's epic Grimaces and Misery—The Saltimbanques (Petit Palais, Paris), of exactly the same date as Seurat's magisterial work and, with its lifesize performers aligned in friezelike formation across a 20-foot stage, a match for his ambition. #SeuratsSideshow ""An enthralling exhibition..."" — New York Times ""Fascinating"" — Wall Street Journal The exhibition is made possible by the Janice H.

The selection features approximately 30 medals from Italy and Northern Europe, including early bronze examples by Pisanello, the celebrated artist who invented this art form in the mid-15th century, as well as rare wax models dating to the 17th century. Works of technical and stylistic virtuosity, the medals combine poignant portraits of contemporary rulers, dignitaries, and literary figures on one side, and rich, symbolic imagery on the other. The commemorative medal epitomized seminal cultural values of the Renaissance period, namely, the emphasis on the primacy of the individual and the revival of classical antiquity. The exhibition, which explores the development and role of the portrait medal in Renaissance culture, as well as production techniques, celebrates the recently published catalogue of the Lehman Collection's holdings of European sculpture and metalwork."

The exhibition opens with works from the late 1960s and early 1970s by artists in America and Europe who brought the lessons of Minimal and Conceptual art to bear on views of nature both raw and acculturated. Also included are a series of unique Polaroid prints made by Walker Evans in Hale County—the setting for his famous 1930s photographs of Alabama sharecroppers—near the end of his life. Images from the 1980s and 1990s attest to a swing away from the ""deskilling"" associated with radical '60s art making and toward a new interest in technically assured large-scale prints that nevertheless incorporated earlier lessons from Land art, Conceptualism, and other postwar avant-garde movements. The exhibition concludes with recently made works—including Wolfgang Staehle's mesmerizing piece Eastpoint (September 15, 2004) (2004–6), which projects a 24-hour cycle of more than 8,000 still images, synchronized to real time, of the same Hudson River that inspired such American painters as Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church. #PoeticsofPlace"

On these intricately carved objects—some measuring a mere two inches (five centimeters) in diameter—the miracles and drama of the Bible unfold on a tiny stage. The execution of these prayer beads and diminutive altarpieces is as miraculous as the stories they tell. This exhibition, the first of its kind, features nearly 50 of these tiny treasures. Among the highlights is a complete carved boxwood rosary made for King Henry VIII of England and his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, before his notorious efforts to dissolve the marriage and his break from the Catholic Church.

2017,The Mysterious Landscapes of Hercules Segers,"February 13–May 21, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/hercules-segers,"The great experimental printmaker Hercules Segers (Dutch, ca. 1590–ca. 1638), one of the most fertile artistic minds of his time, created otherworldly landscapes of astonishing originality. With a unique array of techniques whose identification still puzzles scholars, he etched extraordinary, colorful landscapes and still lifes. Rejecting the idea that prints from a single plate should all look the same in black and white, he produced impressions in varied color schemes—painting them, then adding lines or cutting down the plate. Segers turned each impression of his evocative landscapes into unique miniature paintings that seem out of their time. He was a favorite artist of Rembrandt, who owned eight paintings and one printing plate by Segers. This exhibition is the first to display almost all of Segers's prints in varying impressions alongside a selection of his paintings, and is the first large selection of his fascinating work to be shown in the United States. #HerculesSegers Now at The Met Blog Series Learn more about Hercules Segers's highly innovative techniques and the works on display in this exhibition in a series of articles written by exhibition curator Nadine Orenstein.

2017,Breuer Revisited: New Photographs by Luisa Lambri and Bas Princen,"February 1–May 21, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/breuer-revisited,"This exhibition presents two series of commissioned photographs that reflect on the architecture of Marcel Breuer (Hungarian, 1902–1981). The images on view by the artist Luisa Lambri and the photographer Bas Princen use the Bauhaus architect and designer's important public and municipal works to explore the relationship between the built environment and its inhabitants. Evoking minimalism and abstraction, Lambri creates images that examine the dialogue between interior and exterior and, in these works especially, the interaction between surface and light. Princen investigates and reframes urban and rural spaces through documenting the concept of post-occupancy, or the evolution of a building and its enduring relevance. Their photographs offer two distinct views of how Breuer's monumental modernist buildings, constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, exist today. Saint John's Abbey Church in Collegeville, Minnesota, and the UNESCO headquarters in Paris have been selected for their scale and for their significance to his career. The IBM research center in La Gaude, France, served as the experimental site where sophisticated prefabricated systems for concrete constructions were developed. The fourth building, commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art and now The Met Breuer, was created as a museum for New York and epitomizes the architect's principles. Lambri's and Princen's series give us an opportunity to contemplate the experience of architecture outside the typical framework of the architect's working methods and ideas. #MetBreuer The exhibition is made possible by The Daniel and Estrellita Brodsky Foundation."

Thanks to generous donations and bequests, as well as purchases, the collection of European paintings has grown into one of the finest in the world. But this does not mean it is static or complete. Our understanding of the past is in a constant state of revision, and curators must always be on the lookout for works of art that reshape the stories we tell, sometimes in subtle and other times in striking ways. The department's most important acquisition of the past few years is unquestionably the monumental portrait of the family of the great banker-collector Everhard Jabach by Charles Le Brun—one of the landmarks of French 17th-century painting (on view in gallery 617 ).

Seven exceptional portraits by Velázquez, including The Met's iconic Juan de Pareja (1650), are on view in this focused exhibition, which shows how the artist captured the variety of human experience. Two paintings from the Hispanic Society of America— Portrait of a Young Girl (ca. 1640) and Cardinal Camillo Astalli-Pamphili (ca. 1650–51)—were recently cleaned and restored at The Met and are also displayed.

2017,Max Beckmann in New York,"October 19, 2016–February 20, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/max-beckmann,"This exhibition puts a spotlight on artist Max Beckmann's special connection with New York City, featuring 14 paintings that he created while living in New York from 1949 to 1950, as well as 25 earlier works from New York collections. The exhibition assembles several groups of iconic works, including self-portraits; mythical, expressionist interiors; robust, colorful portraits of women and performers; landscapes; and triptychs. During the late 1920s, Max Beckmann (1884–1950) was at the pinnacle of his career in Germany; his work was presented by prestigious art dealers, he taught at the Städel Art School in Frankfurt, and he moved in a circle of influential writers, critics, publishers, and collectors. After the National Socialists labeled his works ""degenerate"" and confiscated them from German museums in 1937, Beckmann left the country and immigrated to Holland, where he remained for 10 years. In 1947, he accepted a temporary teaching position in St. Louis, Missouri, and in September 1949, he moved to New York City, which he described as ""a prewar Berlin multiplied a hundredfold."" Life in Manhattan energized him and resulted in such powerful pictures as Falling Man (1950) and The Town (City Night) (1950). In late December 1950, Beckmann set out from his apartment on the Upper West Side of New York to see his Self-Portrait in Blue Jacket (1950), which was on view at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in the exhibition American Painting Today . However, on the corner of 69th Street and Central Park West, the 66-year-old artist suffered a fatal heart attack and never made it to the Museum. The poignant circumstance of the artist's death served as the inspiration for this exhibition. #MaxBeckmann The exhibition is made possible by The Isaacson-Draper Foundation.

During the seven decades since The Costume Institute became part of The Met in 1946, that collecting strategy has shifted from creating a collection of Western high fashion that is encyclopedic in breadth to one focused on acquiring masterworks. The exhibition, in the Anna Wintour Costume Center, highlights approximately 60 of these masterworks from the early 18th century to the present. The Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery is organized chronologically with ensembles shown on platforms resembling oversized packing crates. Each object—primarily women's wear, as well as some men's wear ensembles and a selection of accessories—is accompanied by an in-depth explanation of its significance within the canon of fashion history.

Hoping to verify religious faith through the objective documentation of the city's holy sites, he turned to photography, creating one of the most enigmatic bodies of work of the 19th century. Despite a high-caliber photographic oeuvre of great variation and creativity, Salzmann remains relatively unknown. Some three dozen rare salted paper prints from paper negatives have been selected from his influential 1856 album, Jerusalem: A Study and Photographic Reproduction of the Monuments of the Holy City .

Because of their sensitivity to light, these works cannot be on permanent exhibition; each installation remains on view for approximately 13 weeks. The rotations of the gallery consist of diverse pieces—new acquisitions as well as works that might not find their way into a major exhibition. They are selected to show the breadth and quality of the Museum's holdings, ranging from the Renaissance to the present. Highlights from this rotation include Old Master and modern works that engage the theme of repetition, including drawings by Italian artists Annibale Carracci (1560–1609), Mauro Gandolfi (1764–1834), and Carlo Maratti (1625–1713); prints by American artists Anders Bergstrom (born 1971), Roy Lichtenstein (1923–1997), Barnett Newman (1905–1970), Henry Pearson (1914–2006), and Susan Schwalb (born 1944), as well as Swiss artists Pierrette Bloch (born 1928) and Dieter Roth (1930–1998); drawings and prints from the 17th through the 19th century showcasing artists' interpretations of Jerusalem through the lens of history, religion, and mythology; a selection of drawings by Fra Bartolomeo (1473–1517) that explores the broad range of the artist's style and technique as a draftsman on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of his death; and posters, postcards, and photographs that focus on the burgeoning state of California in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
2017,Kerry James Marshall: Mastry,"October 25, 2016–January 29, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/kerry-james-marshall,"This major monographic exhibition is the largest museum retrospective to date of the work of American artist Kerry James Marshall (born 1955). Encompassing nearly 80 works—including 72 paintings—that span the artist's remarkable 35-year career, it reveals Marshall's practice to be one that synthesizes a wide range of pictorial traditions to counter stereotypical representations of black people in society and reassert the place of the black figure within the canon of Western painting. Born before the passage of the Civil Rights Act in Birmingham, Alabama, and witness to the Watts rebellion in 1965, Marshall has long been an inspired and imaginative chronicler of the African American experience. He is known for his large-scale narrative history paintings featuring black figures—defiant assertions of blackness in a medium in which African Americans have long been invisible—and his exploration of art history covers a broad temporal swath stretching from the Renaissance to 20th-century American abstraction. Marshall critically examines and reworks the Western canon through its most archetypal forms: the historical tableau, landscape and genre painting, and portraiture. His work also touches upon vernacular forms such as the muralist tradition and the comic book in order to address and correct, in his words, the ""vacuum in the image bank"" and to make the invisible visible.

2017,Valentin de Boulogne: Beyond Caravaggio,"October 7, 2016–January 22, 2017",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/valentin-de-boulogne,"The greatest French follower of Caravaggio (1571–1610), Valentin de Boulogne (1591–1632) was also one of the outstanding artists in 17th-century Europe. In the years following Caravaggio's death, he emerged as one of the most original protagonists of the new, naturalistic painting. This is the first monographic exhibition devoted to Valentin, who is little known because his career was short-lived—he died at age 41—and his works are so rare. Around 60 paintings by Valentin survive, and this exhibition brings together 45 of them, with works coming from Rome, Vienna, Munich, Madrid, London, and Paris. Exceptionally, the Musée du Louvre, which possesses the most important and extensive body of Valentin's works, is lending all of its paintings by the artist. Although he is not well known to the general public, Valentin has long been admired by those with a passion for Caravaggesque painting. His work was a reference point for the great realists of the 19th century, from Courbet to Manet, and his startlingly vibrant staging of dramatic events and the deep humanity of his figures, who seem touched by a pervasive melancholy, make his work unforgettable. #ValentindeBoulogne Now at The Met Blog Series Learn more about Valentin de Boulogne and the themes of this exhibition in a series of blog posts written by Keith Christiansen and guest authors.

Multiple competitive and complementary religious traditions, fueled by an almost universal preoccupation with the city, gave rise to one of the most creative periods in its history. This landmark exhibition demonstrates the key role that the Holy City played in shaping the art of the period from 1000 to 1400. In these centuries, Jerusalem was home to more cultures, religions, and languages than ever before. Through times of peace as well as war, Jerusalem remained a constant source of inspiration that resulted in art of great beauty and fascinating complexity. This exhibition is the first to unravel the various cultural traditions and aesthetic strands that enriched and enlivened the medieval city. It features some 200 works of art from 60 lenders worldwide.

Unlike many old masters for whom drawing was a preparatory tool, Fragonard explored the potential of chalk, ink, and wash to create sheets that were works of art in their own right. As displays of virtuosity and an imaginative spirit, his drawings have been prized highly from his own day to the present, and New York has long been a center for collecting these works. This exhibition celebrates the artist's achievements as a master draftsman. Among the 100 works on paper on view, nearly half are from private collections, some of which are being shown publicly for the first time. A similar brio and inventiveness mark the artist's etchings, and examples of these are also featured in the selection. The exhibition provides a rare opportunity to see well-loved masterpieces alongside new discoveries and works that have long been out of the public eye. #DrawingTriumphant #MetonPaper100 Now at The Met Blog Series Explore Fragonard's approach to drawing and the works on display in this exhibition in a series of blog posts written by Perrin Stein and guest authors.

In 1984, Heinz Berggruen and his family donated 90 works by Paul Klee to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. These 11 paintings, 71 watercolors, and 8 black-and-white drawings constitute one of the most important gifts in the history of the Museum. Overnight The Met became a major center for the study of this German artist. The earliest work in the collection is a precisely penciled view of Bern drawn in 1893, when Klee was 13 years old, and the latest is a gouache painted in the year of his death. More than half of the works in the collection were executed during the painter's most active years, 1921 through 1931, when he taught at the Bauhaus, first in Weimar and then in Dessau. Marcel Breuer, the architect of The Met Breuer, was also a faculty member and colleague of Klee's at the Bauhaus. #PaulKlee #MetBreuer An Interview with Felix Klee Read a 1986 interview (PDF) with Paul Klee's son, Felix, conducted by exhibition curator Sabine Rewald, in which Felix reminisces about life with his father.

This exhibition brings together some of the Museum's greatest paintings to present this remarkable chapter of art history in a new light. Through sixty-seven works of art organized thematically,In Praise of Paintingorients visitors to key issues in seventeenth-century Dutch culture—from debates about religion and conspicuous consumption to painters' fascination with the domestic lives of women. The exhibition provides a fresh perspective on the canon and parameters of the Dutch Golden Age by uniting paintings from Benjamin Altman's bequest, the Robert Lehman Collection, and the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection. Works typically displayed separately in the Museum's galleries—such as Rembrandt'sGerard de Lairesseand Lairesse's ownApollo and Aurora—are presented side by side, producing a visually compelling narrative about the tensions between realism and idealism during this period. The presentation also provides the opportunity to conserve and display rarely exhibited paintings, including Margareta Haverman'sA Vase of Flowers—one of only two known paintings by the artist and the only painting by an early modern Dutch woman currently in The Met collection. The exhibition takes its title from one of the period's major works of art theory, Philips Angel'sThe Praise of Painting(1642), a pioneering defense of realism in art.

2018,Relative Values: The Cost of Art in the Northern Renaissance,"August 7, 2017–January 23, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/relative-values-northern-renaissance,"Bringing together sixty-two masterpieces of sixteenth-century northern European art from The Met collection and one important loan, this exhibition revolves around questions of historical worth, exploring relative value systems in the Renaissance era. Organized in six sections—raw materials, virtuosity, technological advances, fame, market, and paragone—tapestry, stained and vessel glass, sculpture, paintings, precious metal-work, and enamels are juxtaposed with pricing data from sixteenth-century documents. What did a tapestry cost in the sixteenth century? Goldsmiths' work? Stained glass? How did variables like raw materials, work hours, levels of expertise and artistry, geography, and rarity, affect this? Did production cost necessarily align with perceived market valuation in inventoried collections? Who assigned these values? By exploring different sixteenth-century yardsticks of gauging worth, by probing extrinsic versus intrinsic value, and by presenting works of different media and function side-by-side, the exhibition captures a sense of the splendor and excitement of this era.

The Museum's archaeologists uncovered two-story houses, painted tombs, and a church. They also retrieved objects that reveal the multiple cultural and religious identities of the people who lived in the region. The finds represent a society between the third and seventh centuries A.D., a time of transition between the Roman and early Byzantine periods, which integrated Egyptian, Greek, and Roman culture and art. This exhibition features some thirty works from these excavations. By grouping objects according to the archaeological context in which they were discovered, the exhibition explores the interpretation of ancient identities and artifacts and shows how archaeological documentation can assist in understanding an object's original function. On view are ceramics, ostraca (pottery shards used as writing surfaces), jewelry from burials, glassware, coins, copies of frescoes with early Christian images, and early twentieth-century site photography.

Rather than prioritizing accurate anatomical renderings, artists sought to capture the ""life energy"" of their subjects. This exhibition explores sophisticated decorative arts that depict figures dating to late imperial China, from the Song (960–1279) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Over this thousand-year period, images of humans, legendary figures, and immortals frequently appeared.

We felt the moral crisis of a world in shambles, a world devastated by a great depression and a fierce world war, and it was impossible at that time to paint the kind of painting that we were doing—flowers, reclining nudes, and people playing the cello. . . . So we actually began . . . as if painting were not only dead but had never existed. —Barnett Newman, 1967 Artist and theorist Barnett Newman mythologized the origins of the movement known as Abstract Expressionism as having emerged in the 1940s from a tabula rasa, or ""blank slate."" In truth, the work of the Abstract Expressionists, a group of New York–based painters and sculptors bound loosely by shared interests in mythic themes and European Surrealism, developed within a particular set of historical conditions— particularly emigration from and exchange with Europe, Mexico, Latin America, and Asia, and the city's emergence as a global economic capital. Newman's account rightly suggests the feeling widespread among artists of the period that traditional easel painting and figurative sculpture could no longer adequately convey the modern human condition in the wake of unprecedented misery and devastation, including the 1945 atomic bombings in Japan authorized by the U.S. government. In this context, artists such as Newman, Jackson Pollock, and others came to believe that abstract styles—often executed on a grand scale—most meaningfully expressed contemporary states of being. Epic Abstraction features large-scale abstract painting and sculpture from the 1940s through the early twenty-first century, drawn primarily from The Met collection. Abstract Expressionism serves as the springboard for a thematic installation that intersperses enduring icons with works by lesser-known artists and debuts new acquisitions.

Drawn from American collections and The Met's own holdings, the exhibition showcases some thirty works—figural sculpture, painted barkcloth, rare featherwork, and more—dating from the late eighteenth to the nineteenth century. The presentation offers visitors an opportunity to understand a core principle of Pacific art: the divine is not abstract but very much alive in nature. Atea is a Polynesian cosmological term that refers to the moment when it was believed that light first sparked forth after many eons of thick, engulfing darkness, resulting in the birth of the first generation of gods. Across Polynesia, ritual artifacts were created for the powerful chiefs who descended from these gods and who, as political and religious leaders, were imbued with the spiritual essence ( mana ) of their forbears. Prestige items such as feather cloaks and headdresses reinforced their status and reputation and asserted genealogical connections with their divine ancestors. These spectacular works illustrate the vitality of the natural world and highlight the ways in which Polynesian elites strategically channeled its material potency to enhance their own spiritual efficacy.

Honorific Chants for Hawai'ian Gods Presented in the exhibition gallery, this chant invokes two pairs of principal gods ( akua ) of Hawai'i: first, Ku, who is associated with governance and warfare, and his counterpart Lono, who brings the rains that encourage fertility; and second, KÄne, usually associated with the land, and Kanaloa, who presides over the ocean. Polynesian gods are not easily classifiable and are inherently multiple. The four in this chant derive from earlier deities found in Tahiti and Tonga who are known by similar names: Tu and Rongo, and Tane and Ta'aroa (Tonga: Tangaloa). Recorded on June 11, 2018, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, by Samuel M. 'Ohukani'Åhi'a Gon, III, Marques Hanalei Marzan, Anne Lokomaika'i Lipscomb, and Marie Ke'alohilani Wong"
2018,Essential Korea,"June 7, 2018–September 22, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/essential-korea,"The history of Korean art spans more than five thousand years. Korea's cross-cultural contacts with neighbors near and far—especially China—have played a significant role in shaping its rich and diverse artistic traditions. Korean culture has also provided important inspiration to others, notably Japan. This exhibition offers a window into the essentials of the peninsula's creative output, past and present. Arranged in loosely chronological order are major works from The Met collection, augmented by significant loans from the National Museum of Korea. The pieces represent key genres and themes of Korean art; they include strikingly modern-looking pots and glittering jewelry from ancient burial sites; exquisite Buddhist icons; refined green-glazed celadon; understated white porcelain; and pictorial images, both sophisticated and whimsical, that feature a range of motifs from nature. The Met received its first gift of a Korean object in 1893. The Arts of Korea Gallery opened in 1998. Today, the collection and gallery afford New Yorkers and the Museum's global visitors ongoing explorations of Korea's cultural traditions and innovations."
2018,Streams and Mountains without End: Landscape Traditions of China,"August 26, 2017–August 4, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/streams-and-mountains,"From the standpoint of splendid scenery, painting cannot equal [real] landscape. But when it comes to the wonders of brush and ink, [real] landscape is no match for painting! —Dong Qichang (1555–1636) About a thousand years ago, the Chinese landscape painter Guo Xi posed the question, ""In what does a gentleman's love of landscape consist?"" This question is at the heart of the exhibition, which explores the many uses of landscape in the Chinese visual arts. This exhibition, which showcases more than 120 Chinese landscape paintings in four rotations, offers insights into the tradition, revealing distinctions between types of landscape that might not be obvious at first glance. What appears to be a simple mountain dwelling, for example, turns out to be the villa of the painter's friend, encoding a wish for his happy retirement. Similarly, what seems at first to be a simple study in dry brushwork turns out to be an homage to an old master, an expression of reverence for what has come before. Drawn primarily from The Met's holdings and supplemented by a dozen private loans, the presentation is augmented by decorative art objects with landscape themes.

2018,Artistic Encounters with Indigenous America,"December 3, 2018–May 13, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/artistic-encounters-with-indigenous-america,"Indigenous America has long occupied a unique place in the imagination of non-Native artists. From the moment European explorers arrived in the so-called New World in the fifteenth century, (mis)representations of Native North Americans proliferated in the fine, decorative, and commercial arts. In order to personify peoples they knew little about, European artists invented a visual vocabulary to depict America, creating long-lasting stereotypes such as the ""Indian princess"" and the ""noble savage."" Artists working in the United States in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries inherited these conventions and adapted them to create romanticized images of Native peoples existing apart from the modern world. Facilitated by the advent of photography in the mid-nineteenth century, Indigenous Americans were increasingly subjected to ethnographic documentation, as their destiny as a ""doomed race"" was widely accepted by Euro-Americans. Nostalgia for the ""vanishing Indian"" also motivated artists at the turn of the twentieth century to look to Native cultures, notably in the Southwest, for authentic American subject matter. Occurring amid colonization, genocide, dispossession, and cultural destruction, these artistic encounters with Indigenous America reveal little about the realities of Native life; instead, they reflect the attitudes and anxieties of the artists and societies that produced them. Featuring more than forty works from The Met collection, this exhibition includes drawings, prints, watercolors, photographs, and popular ephemera from the seventeenth to the early twentieth century. To add a broader perspective to this complex historical imagery, contemporary artist Wendy Red Star (Apsáalooke/Crow) was invited to author interpretative labels for the works of her choosing, included on the exhibition object pages below. Red Star draws on her cultural heritage as well as archival research to create art in a variety of media that questions, often in humorous and provocative ways, stereotypes of Native Americans. Artistic Encounters with Indigenous America complements the exhibition Art of Native America: The Charles and Valerie Diker Collection , on view at The Met Fifth Avenue from October 4, 2018, through October 6, 2019.

2018,The Secret Life of Textiles: The Milton Sonday Archive,"December 18, 2017–May 5, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/secret-life-of-textiles,"Textile scholar Milton Sonday is one of the world's foremost authorities on the structures of handmade fabrics, particularly woven textiles and lace. Hired in 1962 by the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C., as a draftsman for a project on Precolumbian ceramics, he was promoted shortly thereafter to assistant curator responsible for carpets. In 1967, he joined the curatorial staff of the Cooper Hewitt Museum. Early in his career, Sonday began to put his artistic skills to use in creating legible and visually pleasing technical drawings that express the weaves of patterned textiles. He went on to teach seminars on fabric analysis, developing various methods that enabled students (even those who claimed they ""couldn't draw"") to re-create and therefore understand the structures of historical textiles. This installation includes a selection of Sonday's studies of lace structures and couched embroidery, loom models for patterned weaves, and diagrams made from classic handwoven textiles. His clear, comprehensible, and attractive drawings and models have become more than didactic tools. The wit and imagination evident in Sonday's choices of materials and colors and the skill with which the works are made has inspired delight and appreciation over the years. In 2012, Sonday donated his research archive to the Antonio Ratti Textile Center at The Met. The first portions are available for study now while the Museum continues cataloguing and processing this treasure trove. Sonday has generously given his time to assist with the ongoing organization of the archive, which spans his entire career and includes his most recent projects."

2018,Julio Le Parc 1959,"December 4, 2018–February 24, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/julio-le-parc-1959,"The first solo exhibition in a New York museum of Argentinian artist Julio Le Parc celebrates the artist's extraordinary gift to The Met of twenty-four works, and also marks the occasion of the artist's ninetieth birthday. Featuring over fifty works, Julio Le Parc 1959 presents a substantial, never-before-seen selection of gouaches from one of the most prolific and transformative years in the artist's career. Born in Mendoza, Argentina, in 1928, Le Parc studied under Lucio Fontana during the 1940s and engaged with abstract avant-garde movements in Buenos Aires. In 1958, Le Parc moved to Paris, where his encounter with Op artists, such as Victor Vasarely, had an important influence on his art. The series of gouaches Le Parc started that year—intimate yet methodical studies of form and color—illuminates his interest in developing geometric abstraction by incorporating movement through variations, sequences, and progressions. This work anticipates his founding role in Kinetic art during the 1960s, when he made paintings and sculptures with movable parts by incorporating mirrors, motors, and electric light. Aiming to make art more accessible and politically relevant, Le Parc also experimented with projected lights in darkened rooms, adding a sense of playfulness and encouraging viewer participation. To represent this achievement, the exhibition also includes the kinetic painting Form in Contortion over Weft (1966) and the immersive installation Continual Light Cylinder (1962/2018).

2018,Dangerous Beauty: Medusa in Classical Art,"February 5, 2018–February 24, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/dangerous-beauty,"Beginning in the fifth century B.C., Medusa—the snaky-haired Gorgon whose gaze turned men to stone—became increasingly anthropomorphic and feminine, undergoing a visual transformation from grotesque to beautiful. A similar shift in representations of other mythical female half-human beings—such as sphinxes, sirens, and the sea monster Scylla—took place at the same time. Featuring sixty artworks, primarily from The Met collection, this exhibition explores how the beautification of these terrifying figures manifested the idealizing humanism of Classical Greek art, and traces their enduring appeal in both Roman and later Western art. The connection between beauty and horror, embodied above all in the figure of Medusa, outlived antiquity, fascinating and inspiring artists through the centuries. Medusa became the archetypical femme fatale, a conflation of femininity, erotic desire, violence, and death. Along with the beautiful Scylla, she foreshadows the conceit of the seductive but threatening female that emerges in the late nineteenth century in reaction to women's empowerment.

2018,Discoveries @30,"November 18, 2018–February 18, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/discoveries-at-30,"Last year marked the thirtieth anniversary of Discoveries , The Met's program for children and adults with developmental and learning disabilities and those on the autism spectrum, along with their friends and families. This exhibition includes works of art created by program participants during the past year, as well as descriptions of the workshops in which they were made. The works demonstrate the themes and materials that inspire these artists to explore, experiment, and develop their creativity. Discoveries educators and volunteers aim to create an engaging and comfortable environment for families to enjoy art at The Met, to make their own art, and to socialize with one another. Since its inception, Discoveries has included participants of all ages, with and without disabilities. Many families have been participating for years, and new families join regularly. Last year, nearly 650 people participated in the twenty-four Discoveries workshops. Discoveries is an important part of The Met's century-long history of creating accessible opportunities for people with disabilities to engage with art. Following the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and subsequent legislation ensuring access to public education for children with disabilities, in the late 1970s, educator Charles Steiner piloted programs inviting adults and children with developmental disabilities to visit the Museum and connect with art. Based on this pioneering initiative, The Met published resources on accessibility and programming for museum and classroom educators and established Disabled Visitor Services, a division of The Met's Education Department. Today, the Access division continues to implement programs and accommodations for people with disabilities in the Museum and beyond its walls and to ensure that all Met programs are designed inclusively. In addition, this team leads Museum-wide initiatives supporting The Met's commitment to accessibility and inclusion of people with disabilities. Congratulations to all the artists whose works are on view in this exhibition and many thanks to all Discoveries participants, educators, and volunteers for contributing to this inclusive and creative community.

In celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the artist's birth, this exhibition explores an innovative and little-studied aspect of Tintoretto's portraiture: small-scale, informal portrait heads characterized by immediacy, intense observation, and startling modernity. These works capture both the appearance and the spirit of the sitter, and are painted with the artist's famous prestezza, or quickness. The exhibition brings together for the first time approximately ten portrait studies from European and American museums and private collections, drawing them into a larger discussion of the artist's portraiture and approach to painting.

Through some 140 objects—including opulent gilded reliquaries, richly illuminated manuscripts, rare textiles, cross stones ( khachkars ), precious liturgical furnishings, church models, and printed books—the exhibition demonstrates how Armenians developed a unique Christian identity that linked their widespread communities over the years.

The collection was originally assembled in the early twentieth century by Dr. Frederick Malling Pedersen (1869–1947) of New York. It later passed by descent to Mr. and Mrs. Morris, who have seen to its care and restoration. Key works include a rare complete armor ( gusoku ) by Bamen Tomotsugu (active eighteenth century); a blade attributed to Fusamune of SÅshÅ« (active late fifteenth–early sixteenth century) with mounting; and a helmet ( kawari-kabuto ) in the shape of a wave (seventeenth century, restored 2015). The gift of choice objects from the collection represents a significant addition to the Museum's holdings of Japanese arms and armor, which are the most comprehensive of their kind outside of Japan."
2018,Delacroix,"September 17, 2018–January 6, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/delacroix,"French painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) was one of the greatest creative figures of the nineteenth century. Coming of age after the fall of Napoleon, he reconnected the present to the past on his own terms. Delacroix produced an extraordinarily vibrant body of work, setting into motion a cascade of innovations that changed the course of art. This exhibition is the first comprehensive retrospective devoted to this amazing artist ever held in North America. The exhibition, a joint project with the Musée du Louvre, illuminates Delacroix's restless imagination through more than 150 paintings, drawings, prints, and manuscripts—many never before seen in the United States. It unfolds chronologically, encompassing the rich variety of themes that preoccupied the artist during his more than four decades of activity, including literature, history, religion, animals, and nature. Through rarely seen graphic art displayed alongside such iconic paintings as Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi (1826), The Battle of Nancy (1831), Women of Algiers in Their Apartment (1834), and Medea about to Kill Her Children (1838), this exhibition explores an artist whose protean genius set the bar for virtually all other French painters.

2018,Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy,"September 18, 2018–January 6, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/everything-is-connected-art-and-conspiracy,"For the last fifty years, artists have explored the hidden operations of power and the symbiotic suspicion between the government and its citizens that haunts Western democracies. Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy is the first major exhibition to tackle this perennially provocative topic. It traces the simultaneous development of two kinds of art about conspiracy. The first half of the exhibition comprises works by artists who hew strictly to the public record, uncovering hidden webs of deceit—from the shell corporations used by New York's largest private landlord, interconnected networks encompassing politicians, businessmen, and arms dealers. In the second part, other artists dive headlong into the fever dreams of the disaffected, creating fantastical works that nevertheless uncover uncomfortable truths in an age of information overload and weakened trust in institutions. Featuring seventy works by thirty artists in media ranging from painting and sculpture to photography, video, and installation art, from 1969 to 2016, Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy presents an alternate history of postwar and contemporary art that is also an archaeology of our troubled times. Accompanied by a catalogue . #MetArtandConspiracy Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy is accompanied by the exhibition Jane and Louise Wilson: Stasi City , on view at The Met Fifth Avenue from September 18, 2018, through March 31, 2019.

Whitten's sculptures, which he first created in New York and later at his summer home on Crete, consist of carved wood, often in combination with found materials sourced from his local environment, including bone, marble, paper, glass, nails, and fishing line. Inspired by art-historical sources rooted in Africa, the ancient Mediterranean, and the Southern United States, Whitten's sculptures not only address the themes of place, memory, family, and migration, they also give expression to a transnational, cosmopolitan perspective. Forty sculptures are joined by eighteen of the artist's paintings, including his entire Black Monolith series, dedicated to African American leaders in art and politics, and by sixteen works of African, Mycenaean, Minoan, Cycladic, and American art from The Met's distinguished collection.

Through a selection of more than one hundred works on paper—from finished watercolors to sketchbooks, from copies after old master prints to preparatory drawings for important projects—this exhibition explores the central role of drawing in Delacroix's practice. The exhibition celebrates a major gift to The Met from Karen B. Cohen, an Honorary Trustee and longtime supporter of the Museum, of her renowned collection of drawings by Delacroix. Assembled with an eye to the artist's process, the collection highlights the ways in which drawing shaped Delacroix's artistic development throughout his career; his application of the medium in the preparation of prints, paintings, and public decorative programs; and his investment in the expressive potential of his materials.

Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. This installation features works that respond to journeys made across land and sea, as well as into spiritual and imaginative realms. Highlights include sixteenth-century drawings in which the experience of revelation is expressed through light; a group of prints by the Dutch engraver Hendrick Goudt (1583–1648); seventeenth-century thesis prints from across Europe; early modern manuals and albums about the instruction and exercise of penmanship; drawings modeled on prints and the culture of artistic pedagogy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; recently acquired watercolors by the British watercolorist John Sell Cotman (1782–1842) that offer an overview of his influential career; prints and drawings by the eighteenth-century Irish artist James Barry (1741–1806) that relate to significant murals he painted at London's Society of Arts; a group of red chalk drawings explore that medium's range and potential; ""penny-black"" postage stamps and medals designed by William Wyon (1795–1851) that explore how the young Queen Victoria's public image was molded and circulated; and eighteenth-century devotional images that combine printed and drawn elements with paint, fabric, and other materials.

2018,"Obsession: Nudes by Klimt, Schiele, and Picasso from the Scofield Thayer Collection","July 3–October 7, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/obsession,"This exhibition at The Met Breuer presents a selection of some fifty works from The Met's Scofield Thayer Collection—a collection that is best known for paintings by artists of the school of Paris, and a brilliant group of erotic and evocative watercolors, drawings, and prints by Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Pablo Picasso, whose subjects, except for a handful, are nudes. The exhibition is the first time these works have been shown together, and provides a focused look at this important collection; it also marks the centenary of the deaths of Klimt and Schiele. An aesthete and scion of a wealthy family, Scofield Thayer (1889–1982) was co-owner and editor of the literary magazine the Dial from 1919 to 1926. In this avant-garde journal he introduced Americans to the writings of T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, D. H. Lawrence, Arthur Schnitzler, Thomas Mann, and Marcel Proust, among others. He frequently accompanied these writers' contributions with reproductions of modern art. Thayer assembled his large collection of some six hundred works—mostly works on paper—with staggering speed in London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna between 1921 and 1923. While he was a patient of Sigmund Freud in Vienna, he acquired a large group of watercolors and drawings by Schiele and Klimt, artists who at that time were unknown in America. When a selection from his collection was shown at the Montross Gallery in New York in 1924—five years before the Museum of Modern Art opened—it won acclaim. It found no favor, however, in Thayer's native city, Worcester, Massachusetts, that same year when it was shown at the Worcester Art Museum. Incensed, Thayer drew up his will in 1925, leaving his collection to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. He withdrew from public life in the late 1920s and lived as a recluse on Martha's Vineyard and in Florida until his death in 1982. Accompanied by a catalogue .

2018,Public Service Announcement: Works by Eva Koťátková and Rachel Harrison,"March 26–September 18, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/public-service-announcement,"This exhibition presents three exemplary works from The Met collection by Czech artist Eva KoÅ¥átková (born 1982) and American artist Rachel Harrison (born 1966). KoÅ¥átková and Harrison each reinvent the tradition of the readymade—a term first coined by French artist Marcel Duchamp in 1915 to describe his unconventional sculptures—reclaiming found materials to create collages and assemblages. KoÅ¥átková's sprawling installation Untitled (Unlearning Instincts) , composed of 96 collages made of photographs clipped from books and magazines, explores subjects such as pedagogy and the process of social and political indoctrination. Harrison's two sculptures place preexisting images and objects in settings constructed by the artist to comment obliquely on matters relating to race, gender, sexuality, and politics. In each case, appropriating, juxtaposing, and recontextualizing readymade items not only generates chains of associations—it also makes the familiar appear strange."

Typically composed of numerous non-representational forms, Shettar's immersive environments are inspired by her observations of the now-threatened natural environs of rural India. For Seven ponds and a few raindrops (2017), the artist molded pieces of stainless steel into a series of sensual, curved, amoebic, shape-shifting elements that have been covered in tamarind-stained muslin. Suspended from the ceiling, the work seems to defy gravity, casting a series of mesmerizing shadows, which, from a distance, evoke the sense of having stumbled upon a surreal, hidden-away oasis.

2018,"Public Parks, Private Gardens: Paris to Provence","March 12–July 29, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/public-parks-private-gardens,"Following in the footsteps of nineteenth-century artists who celebrated the out-of-doors as a place of leisure, renewal, and inspiration, this exhibition explores horticultural developments that reshaped the landscape of France and grounded innovative movements—artistic and green—in an era that gave rise to Naturalism, Impressionism, and Art Nouveau. As shiploads of exotic botanical specimens arrived from abroad and local nurserymen pursued hybridization, the availability and variety of plants and flowers grew exponentially, as did the interest in them. The opening up of formerly royal properties and the transformation of Paris during the Second Empire into a city of tree-lined boulevards and parks introduced public green spaces to be enjoyed as open-air salons, while suburbanites and country-house dwellers were prompted to cultivate their own flower gardens. By 1860, the French journalist Eugène Chapus could write: ""One of the pronounced characteristics of our Parisian society is that . . . everyone in the middle class wants to have his little house with trees, roses, and dahlias, his big or little garden, his rural piece of the good life."" The important role of parks and gardens in French life during this period is richly illustrated by paintings, drawings, photographs, prints, illustrated books, and objects in The Met collection by artists extending from Camille Corot to Henri Matisse, many of whom were gardeners themselves. Drawn from seven curatorial departments at The Met and supplemented by a selection of private collection loans, Public Parks, Private Gardens: Paris to Provence features some 150 works by more than 70 artists, spanning the late eighteenth through early twentieth century. Anchored by Impressionist scenes of outdoor leisure, the presentation offers a fresh, multisided perspective on best-known and hidden treasures housed in a Museum that took root in a park: namely, New York's Central Park, which was designed in the spirit of Parisian public parks of the same period. #ParksandGardens Accompanied by a catalogue .

2018,Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints: Life at Court,"May 1–July 29, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/drawings-and-prints-may-rotation,"In conjunction with the exhibition Visitors to Versailles (1682–1789) , this installation explores various aspects of life at court through works on paper from the Department of Drawings and Prints. The French château at Versailles was but one among a great multitude of princely, stately, royal, and papal courts in the early modern period. While each was influenced by local traditions and the personal idiosyncrasies of its ruler, they also had many common features and customs, which are examined in this installation through thematic selections of drawings, prints, and illustrated books. Representations and designs for palaces, from Frederiksborg Castle in Denmark to the Villa Estense in Tivoli, show how the power of a court is reflected in imposing architecture, lavish interiors, and intricately planned gardens. The various forms of entertainment organized for rulers and courtiers are highlighted in works such as Louis Jean Desprez's imposing scenographic design for the opera Electra , and Stradanus's tapestry designs with hunting parties. Prints by Romeyn de Hooghe , Goya , and other artists illustrate how official portraits not only conveyed the likeness of the sovereign, but also communicated ideas about their reign, dynasty, triumphs, and aspirations. The depiction of rulers in military garb, such as the Medici Duke Cosimo I in full armor, or even leading armies into battle, as in François Vincent's portrayal of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt , added an another dimension to dynastic portraiture, emphasizing their strength and bravery in protecting the territory and citizens they ruled over.

2018,Visitors to Versailles (1682–1789),"April 16–July 29, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/visitors-to-versailles,"The palace of Versailles and its gardens have attracted travelers ever since it was transformed under the direction of the Sun King, Louis XIV, from a simple hunting lodge into one of the most magnificent and public courts of Europe. French and foreign travelers, including royalty, ambassadors, artists, musicians, writers, scientists, grand tourists, and day-trippers, all flocked to the royal palace surrounded by its extensive formal gardens. Versailles was always a truly international setting, and not only drew visitors from Europe and America, but also hosted dignitaries from as far away as Thailand, India, and Tunisia. Their official receptions at Versailles and gift exchanges with the king were among the attractions widely recorded in tourists' diaries and court gazettes. Bringing together works from The Met, the Château de Versailles, and over fifty lenders, this exhibition highlights the experiences of travelers from 1682, when Louis XIV moved his court to Versailles, to 1789, when the royal family was forced to leave the palace and return to Paris. Through paintings, portraits, furniture, tapestries, carpets, costumes, porcelain, sculpture, arms and armor, and guidebooks, the exhibition illustrates what visitors encountered at court, what kind of welcome and access to the palace they received, and, most importantly, what impressions, gifts, and souvenirs they took home with them. #VisitorsToVersailles Accompanied by a catalogue and a free 3-D audio experience , which brings to life the impressions of those who visited the palace and court in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

2018,"Painted in Mexico, 1700–1790:Pinxit Mexici","April 24–July 22, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/pinxit-mexici,"The vitality and inventiveness of artists in eighteenth-century New Spain (Mexico) is the focus of this exhibition, which presents some 110 works of art (primarily paintings), many of which are unpublished and newly restored. The exhibition surveys the most important artists and stylistic developments of the period and highlights the emergence of new pictorial genres and subjects. It is the first major exhibition devoted to this neglected topic. The eighteenth century ushered in a period of pictorial splendor in Mexico as local schools of painting were consolidated, new iconographies were invented, and painters explored new ways to invigorate their art. Attesting to their extraordinary versatility, the artists who created mural-size paintings to cover the walls of sacristies, choirs, and university halls were often the same ones who produced portraits, casta paintings (depictions of racially mixed families), painted folding screens, and finely rendered devotional imagery. The volume of work produced by the four generations of Mexican artists that spanned the eighteenth century is virtually unmatched elsewhere in the Spanish world. The growing professional self-awareness of artists during the period led many educated painters not only to sign their works to emphasize their authorship but also to make explicit reference to Mexico as their place of origin through the Latin phrase pinxit Mexici (painted in Mexico). This expression eloquently encapsulates the painters' pride in their own tradition and their connection to larger, transatlantic trends.

2018,Spirited Creatures: Animal Representations in Chinese Silk and Lacquer,"October 21, 2017–July 22, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/spirited-creatures,"This exhibition explores how real and mythical animals—such as the dragon, unicorn, phoenix, lion, ox, and butterfly—are depicted on luxury materials of late imperial China. Presenting twenty textiles and fifty lacquers spanning several hundred years—from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century—the exhibition highlights the imagery on a wide range of objects: dragon robes, rank badges, and tapestry panels for interior decoration, as well as many different types of lacquer vessels from imperial workshops. The objects are drawn exclusively from The Met collection, and some have not been on display for several decades. Among the works on view are two carved red-lacquer pieces from the early fifteenth century: dish with two birds and peonies has a lavish image treatment typical of the period; and sutra box with dragons amid clouds , which depicts a sinewy dragon, is representative of the elegant boxes produced for use both at the court and as diplomatic gifts, particularly to Tibet. Also of note is a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century woman's informal robe covered with embroidered butterflies. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2018,"Like Life: Sculpture, Color, and the Body (1300–Now)","March 21–July 22, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/like-life,"Seven hundred years of sculptural practice—from fourteenth-century Europe to the global present—are examined anew in this groundbreaking exhibition. Like Life: Sculpture, Color, and the Body (1300–Now) explores narratives of sculpture in which artists have sought to replicate the literal, living presence of the human body. On view exclusively at The Met Breuer, this major international loan exhibition of about 120 works draws on The Met's rich collections of European sculpture and modern and contemporary art, while also featuring a selection of important works from national and international museums and private collections. Just how perfectly should figurative sculpture resemble the human body? Histories and theories of Western sculpture have typically favored idealized representations, as exemplified by the austere, white marble statuary of the classical tradition. Such works create the fiction of bodies existing outside time, space, and personal or cultural experience. Like Life , by contrast, places key sculptures from different eras in conversation with each other, in order to examine the age-old problem of realism and the different strategies deployed by artists to blur the distinctions between original and copy, and life and art. Foremost among these is the application of color to imitate skin and flesh. Other tactics include the use of casts taken from real bodies, dressing sculpted figures in clothing, constructing moveable limbs and automated bodies, even incorporating human blood, hair, teeth, and bones. Uncanny in their approximation of life, such works have the potential to unsettle and disarm observers, forcing us to consider how we see ourselves and others, and to think deeply about our common humanity. Juxtaposing well-known masterpieces with surprising and little-seen works, the exhibition brings together sculptures by artists from Donatello, El Greco, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Antonio Canova, Auguste Rodin, and Edgar Degas to Louise Bourgeois, Meret Oppenheim, Isa Genzken, Charles Ray, Fred Wilson, Robert Gober, Bharti Kher, Duane Hanson, Jeff Koons, and Yinka Shonibare MBE, as well as wax effigies, reliquaries, mannequins, and anatomical models. Together, these works highlight the continuing anxieties and pleasures attendant upon the three-dimensional simulation of the human body. #MetLikeLife Accompanied by a catalogue and an Audio Guide .

2018,Before/On/After: William Wegman and California Conceptualism,"January 17–July 15, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/william-wegman,"This exhibition surveys Conceptual art as it developed in Southern California in the 1970s. It is occasioned by the artist William Wegman's extraordinary recent gift to the Museum of 174 short videos that he made between 1970 and 1999—his entire career in this medium. A ninety-minute selection of videos from this gift is shown accompanied by photographs and drawings by Wegman as well as drawings, prints, and photographs by his contemporaries in Southern California such as John Baldessari, Vija Celmins, Douglas Huebler, Ed Ruscha, and others. Wegman took up video while studying painting at the University of Wisconsin. Like many artists using the then-new medium, Wegman appreciated video, like photography, for its lo-fi reproducibility and anti-artistic qualities—and unlike film, where the negative must be developed and processed before viewing, video was like a sketchbook that allowed revision in real time. It wasn't until he moved to Southern California in 1970 that his video production took off. Although he only lived in Los Angeles for three years, Wegman found his method: short, staged vignettes using everyday items in which expectations are reversed, puns and homonyms are pursued to absurd conclusions. The artist's key early collaborator for most of these short videos was his pet Weimaraner Man Ray, who enthusiastically participates in the goings on. In contrast to other early adopters of video, Wegman eschewed an aesthetic of boredom for humorous improvised scenarios in which he deflated the pretensions of painting and sculpture while also lampooning the pieties and self-seriousness of Conceptual Art—at a time when it was being codified and institutionalized. Beneath the slacker humor, however, are poignant points about failure and the reversal of expectations that chime with work by fellow West Coast Conceptualist friends and fellow travelers also featured in the exhibition. Related Content In this interview, exhibition curator Doug Eklund speaks about the embrace of humor, failure as an aesthetic strategy, image-text combinations, and dogs in West Coast Conceptual art. Read "" No Dogs Allowed: How William Wegman Broke the Rules of Conceptual Art "" on Collection Insights .

2018,Celebrating the Year of the Dog,"January 19–July 4, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/year-of-dog,"The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating twelve-year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the twelve animals in the East Asian zodiac (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig). These animals were first associated with the lunar calendar in China in the third century B.C., becoming firmly established by the first century. Each animal is believed to embody certain traits expressed in the character of the people born in that year. This Lunar New Year, which begins on February 16, 2018, is the Year of the Dog. People born in this year are thought to be active, loyal, and vigilant. Commonly known as ""man's best friend,"" the dog, as one of the earliest domesticated animals, has long performed many essential tasks, including hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. Archaeological evidence indicates that dogs were buried to accompany the deceased as early as in China's Shang dynasty (ca. 1500–1046 B.C.). By the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220), dogs were frequently represented in painting and metalwork, as well as in pottery tomb figures, and they remained a popular motif across all media for two millennia. To celebrate the Year of the Dog, this exhibition presents a selection of remarkable works, exclusively from The Met collection, that illustrate the animal's close association with Chinese daily life."
2018,American Painters in Italy: From Copley to Sargent,"February 13–June 17, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/american-painters-in-italy,"Since the founding of the United States, American painters have been attracted to the celebrated art, ancient ruins, and picturesque scenery of Italy. This exhibition of works from the Museum's collection features watercolors, drawings, and sketchbooks by eighteen American artists who traveled to and were inspired by Italy from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century. Among the best known are John Singleton Copley, Thomas Sully, George Inness, James McNeill Whistler, Maurice Prendergast, and John Singer Sargent. Sargent, who was born in Italy and maintained a lifelong interest in the country's art and scenery, is represented by ten works, including an early scrapbook never before shown at The Met. Organized thematically, American Painters in Italy begins with views of the landscape around Rome, the Campagna, and southern Italy. The second section features images of Venice, which was a particularly popular destination for artists in the late nineteenth century. The final section focuses on works in which the artists copied Italian art as an educational exercise or to signify their sophistication and worldliness.

2018,Golden Kingdoms: Luxury and Legacy in the Ancient Americas,"February 28–May 28, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/golden-kingdoms,"Español This landmark exhibition of luxury arts of the Incas, the Aztecs, and their predecessors traces the emergence and florescence of goldworking in the ancient Americas, from its earliest appearance in the Andes to its later developments farther north in Central America and Mexico. In the ancient Americas, metalworking developed in the context of ritual and regalia, rather than for tools, weapons, or currency. Golden Kingdoms reveals the distinctive ways ancient Americans used not only metals, but also jade, shell, and feathers—materials often considered more valuable than gold. Bringing together newly discovered archaeological finds and masterpieces from major museums in Latin America, Europe, and the United States, this exhibition casts new light on these ancient civilizations and their place within world history. Golden Kingdoms focuses on specific places and times—crucibles of innovation, moments of exceptional achievement in the arts—to explore how materials were selected and transformed, imbued with meaning, and deployed in the most important rituals of their time. This unprecedented exhibition features more than three hundred works from fifty-two lenders in twelve countries. #GoldenKingdoms Accompanied by a catalogue and an Audio Guide .

2018,Leon Golub: Raw Nerve,"February 6–May 27, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/leon-golub,"The gift of Gigantomachy II (1966) to The Met in 2016 by The Nancy Spero and Leon Golub Foundation for the Arts, with the support of the artists' sons, Stephen, Philip, and Paul Golub, is the occasion for this selective survey of Leon Golub's work. Born in Chicago, Golub (1922–2004) occupies a singular position in the history of mid- to late 20th-century art. His devotion to the figure, his embrace of expressionism, his fusion of modern and classical sources, and his commitment to social justice distinguish his practice as an artist. Alongside the monumental, terrifying Gigantomachy II , Leon Golub: Raw Nerve features paintings from the artist's most important series, including Pylon , White Squad , Riot , and Horsing Around . These are accompanied by a suite of early paintings that reflect Golub's study of antiquity, a group of unsettling portraits of the Brazilian dictator Ernesto Geisel, and works on paper that represent subjects of longstanding interest to the artist, from mercenaries, interrogators, and the victims of violence to political figures, nudes, and animals, all of them rendered in the raw, visceral style for which he is justly celebrated. Together, these paintings attest to Golub's incisive perspective on the catastrophes that afflict human civilization and his critique of brutality and belligerent masculinity. The artist's work has much to teach us in the twenty-first century, as does his belief in the ethical responsibility of artists.

2018,Thomas Cole's Journey: Atlantic Crossings,"January 30–May 13, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/thomas-cole,"Celebrated as one of America's preeminent landscape painters, Thomas Cole (1801–1848) was born in northern England at the start of the Industrial Revolution, immigrated to the United States in his youth, and traveled extensively throughout England and Italy as a young artist. He returned to America to create some of his most ambitious works and inspire a new generation of American painters. This exhibition examines for the first time the artist's career in relation to his European roots and travels, establishing Cole as a major figure in nineteenth-century landscape art within a global context. Thomas Cole's Journey marks the two-hundredth anniversary of Cole's first Atlantic crossing, when he emigrated from England to the United States in 1818, and examines in depth Cole's return journey to England in 1829–31 and his travels in Italy in 1831–32, revealing the development of his artistic processes. Seminal works created by the artist in the years immediately after his return to New York, between 1832 and 1837—notably The Oxbow and The Course of Empire —are presented as a culminating creative response to his complex experiences of British art and society and of Italian history and landscape. In addition, Cole's abiding passion for the American wilderness resulted in his fervent visual warning in these paintings to his fellow American citizens of the harsh ecological cost of unchecked development of the land. This exhibition brings to prominence the dialogue between American and European artists in the mid-nineteenth century by hanging Cole's work in direct juxtaposition with works he studied on his formative journey, including paintings by J. M. W. Turner and John Constable, among others. It concludes with an examination of Cole's extraordinary legacy in the work of the next generation of American landscape painters whom he personally mentored, notably Asher B. Durand and Frederic E. Church. #ThomasCole Accompanied by a catalogue .

This shadowy profile of a fedora-topped man immediately inspired Cornell to begin a new series: some 18 boxes, two collages, and one sand tray created in homage to Juan Gris, whom he called a ""warm fraternal spirit."" Completed over a period of 15 years, Cornell's series of Gris shadow boxes is more extensive in number than any other that the artist openly dedicated to one of his admired luminaries of stage, screen, literature, or the visual arts. The main protagonist of Cornell's Juan Gris series is a bird—the great, white-crested cockatoo—specifically, an image taken from a 19th-century print of the species that Cornell repeatedly used in photostats, silhouettes, and hollow cuts of the bird's form to explore the fascinating shadows that Gris produced in his own practice. At The Met, the exhibition Birds of a Feather: Joseph Cornell's Homage to Juan Gris reunites for the first time nearly a dozen boxes from Cornell's Gris series together with the Cubist masterpiece, The Man at the Café . Birds of a Feather: Joseph Cornell's Homage to Juan Gris inaugurates a series of dossier exhibitions under the auspices of the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Featured Media The exhibition is made possible by the Eugene V. and Clare E. Thaw Charitable Trust.

2018,Provocations: Anselm Kiefer at The Met Breuer,"December 13, 2017–April 8, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/anselm-kiefer,"Throughout his nearly fifty-year career, the German artist Anselm Kiefer (born 1945) has never been afraid to wrestle with the past. In 1969, toward the end of his studies at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe, he photographed himself in his father's Wehrmacht uniform, posing before historic monuments and Romantic seascapes in Europe with his arm extended in an illegal Nazi salute. Six years later, the artist selected eighteen of these images for a photo-essay titled ""Occupations,"" which met with widespread public outcry. Indeed, while Kiefer's artistic provocation ran counter to the intense process of postwar denazification, which included the destruction of offensive monuments and other symbols of Germany's infamous history, it was also a threat to a kind of collective amnesia that had overtaken West Germany in the 1960s and 1970s. In his continuing effort to disinter the past, in the 1980s Kiefer began to reuse old photographs for new projects and also extend his artistic means. He added new materials, such as earth, lead, and hay, and approached his works in near-alchemical ways. He also turned to monumental themes (including architecture, cosmology, and mysticism) to further ponder time and existence. While his ambition still grows in scale—today, his projects take over his nearly 400,000-square-foot studio outside Paris—his art, particularly in its worked and layered surfaces weathered by time and nature, remains a visceral and poetic consideration of the past as a means to understand our collective present and, by implication, our future. The works presented here, drawn from The Met collection, also offer us an opportunity to reflect on our own nation and the conflicted history we struggle to readdress today. The exhibition is made possible by Maria-Gaetana Matisse."

Quicksilver Brilliance is the first museum exhibition devoted to the artist in more than twenty years and the first ever at The Met. Some forty works, drawn entirely from The Met collection, demonstrate the impressive breadth of his career. The exhibition includes dazzling portraits of well-known figures of his time: the American socialite Rita de Acosta Lydig; art patron and designer Count Étienne de Beaumont; aristocrat and society hostess Lady Ottoline Morrell; and celebrated entertainer Josephine Baker, among others. A highlight of the presentation is an exceptional book—one of only seven known copies—documenting Nijinsky's scandalous 1912 ballet L'Après-midi d'un faune . This rare album represents de Meyer's great success in capturing the movement and choreography of dance, a breakthrough in the history of photography. Also on view are the artist's early snapshots made in Japan, experiments with color processes, and inventive fashion photographs.

2018,The Silver Caesars: A Renaissance Mystery,"December 12, 2017–March 12, 2018",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/silver-caesars,"This exhibition is dedicated to the extraordinary set of twelve silver-gilt standing cups known collectively as the Aldobrandini Tazze. The tazze are reunited and displayed together for the first time since the mid-nineteenth century, when the objects were disassembled and dispersed, their constituent parts misidentified and mismatched. The exhibition thus provides visitors with a rare opportunity to appreciate one of the finest and most enigmatic monuments of sixteenth-century goldsmiths' work. Properly reassembled, the tazze bring to life the history of the first twelve Caesars, as recounted by the Roman historian Suetonius. Each stands over a foot high and is composed of a shallow footed dish surmounted by the figure of one of the Caesars; four scenes from Suetonius's Life of the relevant ruler appear intricately wrought upon the concave interior of each dish. The Silver Caesars highlights the elegance and erudition of the tazze, presenting them together with a small selection of relevant works in silver as well as in other media—including both ancient and Renaissance coins and medals, and Renaissance prints, books, and paintings. The exhibition also addresses the set's later history by presenting eighteenth- and nineteenth-century works that the tazze inspired. In addition to offering new insights into the tazze and their history, the exhibition also explores the set's famously mysterious reputation—engaging the visitor in tracing clues that may lead to a better understanding of this Renaissance masterpiece.

This major retrospective—the exhibition's only North American venue—honors the artist in his 80th year by presenting his most iconic works and key moments of his career from 1960 to the present. Working in a wide range of media with equal measures of wit and intelligence, Hockney has examined, probed, and questioned how to capture the perceived world of movement, space, and time in two dimensions. The exhibition offers a grand overview of the artist's achievements across all media, including painting, drawing, photography, and video. From his early experiments with modernist abstraction and mid-career experiments with illusion and realism, to his most recent, jewel-toned landscapes, Hockney has consistently explored the nature of perception and representation with both intellectual rigor and sheer delight in the act of looking. #Hockney Featured Media The Animals: Love Letters Between Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy Mickalene Thomas on David Hockney | Artists on Artworks ""Ravishing . . . a revelation"" — New Yorker ""Delightful, absorbing exhibition"" — New York Times ""One of the delights of the season"" — Washington Post The exhibition is made possible in part by The Horace W.

During his long life, Michelangelo was celebrated for the excellence of his disegno , the power of drawing and invention that provided the foundation for all the arts. For his mastery of drawing, design, sculpture, painting, and architecture, he was called Il Divino (""the divine one"") by his contemporaries. His powerful imagery and dazzling technical virtuosity transported viewers and imbued all of his works with a staggering force that continues to enthrall us today. This exhibition presents a stunning range and number of works by the artist: 133 of his drawings, three of his marble sculptures, his earliest painting, his wood architectural model for a chapel vault, as well as a substantial body of complementary works by other artists for comparison and context.

The years between 1950 and 1980 were beset by upheaval. Around the globe, military conflict proliferated and social and political unrest flared. Disenchantment with an oppressive rationalism mounted, as did a corollary interest in fantastic, hallucinatory experiences. Artists responded to these developments by incorporating absurdity, disorder, nonsense, disorientation, and repetition into their work. In the process, they destabilize space and perception, give form to extreme mental, emotional, and physical states, and derange otherwise logical structures and techniques. Delirious explores the embrace of irrationality among American, Latin American, and European artists. Divided into four sections—Vertigo, Excess, Nonsense, and Twisted—this exhibition showcases roughly 100 works of art by 62 artists, including Antonio Berni, Dara Birnbaum, Tony Conrad, Hanne Darboven, Dean Fleming, Nancy Grossman, Philip Guston, Eva Hesse, Alfred Jensen, Yayoi Kusama, Sol LeWitt, Darcílio Lima, Lee Lozano, Anna Maria Maiolino, Ana Mendieta, Bruce Nauman, Jim Nutt, Hélio Oiticica, Claes Oldenburg, Abraham Palatnik, Howardena Pindell, Peter Saul, Mira Schendel, Carolee Schneemann, Paul Sharits, Robert Smithson, Nancy Spero, Paul Thek, and Stan VanDerBeek. About a third of the exhibition is drawn from The Met collection. Linked by a common distrust of reason, the featured works alternately simulate and stimulate delirium, straining the limits of both legibility and intelligibility. Ultimately, the exhibition asks if it is possible to understand a good deal of postwar art, even seemingly rational art, as an exercise in calculated lunacy. #DeliriousMet #MetBreuer Featured Media Conversation on Delirious Art and Times ""Restless, daring show ... a nervy multimedia survey of postwar art."" — New York Times The catalogue is made possible by the Antoinette Kraushaar Fund and Marsha and Jeffrey Perelman.

Born into an aristocratic family in Rajasthan, he lived in Hong Kong, Paris, London, and New York—but his eye was perpetually drawn back to his native India. This retrospective exhibition situates Singh's photographic work at the intersection of Western modernism and traditional South Asian modes of picturing the world. It features 85 photographs by Singh in counterpoint with works by his contemporaries—friends, collaborators, fellow travelers—as well as examples of the Indian court painting styles that inspired him. The exhibition traces the full trajectory of Singh's career from his early work as a photojournalist in the late 1960s through his last unpublished projects of the late 1990s. Using a handheld camera and color slide film, he recorded India's dense milieu in complex frieze-like compositions teeming with incident, fractured by reflections, and pulsating with opulent color. Singh embraced color as part of a continuous Indian aesthetic tradition that reaches back to the miniature paintings of the Mughal period. He was also deeply influenced by the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson (whom he met in Jaipur in 1966), Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray, and American street photographers such as William Gedney and Lee Friedlander. As he traveled along his own artistic path, Singh forged a distinctively Indian style of modernist photography that stands, as he put it, ""on the Ganges side of modernism."" #RaghubirSingh Featured Media Performance The exhibition is made possible by Nita and Mukesh Ambani and the Reliance Foundation.

This exhibition brings together some of the Museum's greatest paintings to present this remarkable chapter of art history in a new light. Through sixty-seven works of art organized thematically,In Praise of Paintingorients visitors to key issues in seventeenth-century Dutch culture—from debates about religion and conspicuous consumption to painters' fascination with the domestic lives of women. The exhibition provides a fresh perspective on the canon and parameters of the Dutch Golden Age by uniting paintings from Benjamin Altman's bequest, the Robert Lehman Collection, and the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection. Works typically displayed separately in the Museum's galleries—such as Rembrandt'sGerard de Lairesseand Lairesse's ownApollo and Aurora—are presented side by side, producing a visually compelling narrative about the tensions between realism and idealism during this period. The presentation also provides the opportunity to conserve and display rarely exhibited paintings, including Margareta Haverman'sA Vase of Flowers—one of only two known paintings by the artist and the only painting by an early modern Dutch woman currently in The Met collection. The exhibition takes its title from one of the period's major works of art theory, Philips Angel'sThe Praise of Painting(1642), a pioneering defense of realism in art.

2019,Relative Values: The Cost of Art in the Northern Renaissance,"August 7, 2017–January 23, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/relative-values-northern-renaissance,"Bringing together sixty-two masterpieces of sixteenth-century northern European art from The Met collection and one important loan, this exhibition revolves around questions of historical worth, exploring relative value systems in the Renaissance era. Organized in six sections—raw materials, virtuosity, technological advances, fame, market, and paragone—tapestry, stained and vessel glass, sculpture, paintings, precious metal-work, and enamels are juxtaposed with pricing data from sixteenth-century documents. What did a tapestry cost in the sixteenth century? Goldsmiths' work? Stained glass? How did variables like raw materials, work hours, levels of expertise and artistry, geography, and rarity, affect this? Did production cost necessarily align with perceived market valuation in inventoried collections? Who assigned these values? By exploring different sixteenth-century yardsticks of gauging worth, by probing extrinsic versus intrinsic value, and by presenting works of different media and function side-by-side, the exhibition captures a sense of the splendor and excitement of this era.

Recent archaeological, ethnohistorical, and art-historical research has deepened our understanding of indigenous Caribbean concepts of ritual knowledge, ceremonial performance, and political power. Artists in the region—which includes the modern Antilles archipelago and countries such as Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Honduras—sought to express the distinct force of their deities and ancestors, known to the Taínos as zemí (or cemí ), which pervaded the environment and was crucial to the foundation of communities. Pendants and other objects worn and used by leaders in ceremonies were created from imported luxury materials and share a formal grammar that is inextricably linked with deeply rooted mythological narratives. Works of art on view in the exhibition, largely drawn from The Met collection, celebrate the region's ancestral traditions, and a twentieth-century painting by an Afro-Caribbean artist explores their enduring legacy.

Monkman, born in Canada in 1965, is a Cree artist widely known for his provocative interventions into Western European and American art history. He explores themes of colonization, sexuality, loss, and resilience—the complexities of historic and contemporary Indigenous experiences—across a variety of mediums, including painting, film, performance, and installation. Monkman's gender-fluid alter ego, Miss Chief Eagle Testickle, often appears in his work as a time-traveling, shape-shifting, supernatural being who reverses the colonial gaze to challenge received notions of history and Indigenous peoples.

The Museum's archaeologists uncovered two-story houses, painted tombs, and a church. They also retrieved objects that reveal the multiple cultural and religious identities of the people who lived in the region. The finds represent a society between the third and seventh centuries A.D., a time of transition between the Roman and early Byzantine periods, which integrated Egyptian, Greek, and Roman culture and art. This exhibition features some thirty works from these excavations. By grouping objects according to the archaeological context in which they were discovered, the exhibition explores the interpretation of ancient identities and artifacts and shows how archaeological documentation can assist in understanding an object's original function. On view are ceramics, ostraca (pottery shards used as writing surfaces), jewelry from burials, glassware, coins, copies of frescoes with early Christian images, and early twentieth-century site photography.

The philosophical dimension of the story finds visual expression in these images, particularly its interest in the themes of morality, kingship, and Rama's status as a divine manifestation (or avatar) of Vishnu.

A selection of over fifty paintings by masters of various schools are accompanied by a rare fourteenth-century suit of armor, splendid export lacquers made for the European market in the late sixteenth-century, exquisite eighteenth-century Noh robes, as well as austere tea wares with characteristic imperfections. Heian-kyÅ, as modern-day Kyoto was once referred to, became the seat of the imperial court in 794 and remained the capital of Japan until 1869, when the court was transferred to Tokyo. The rich cultural heritage of this city was profoundly shaped by the presence of the emperor and aristocrats as well as high-ranking warriors, varied groups of artists, and literati working in the orbit of the palace. Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, Noh theaters, workshops of painters and lacquer artists, ceramic kilns, textile shops, a flourishing tea culture, and bustling market districts, as well as supremely elegant architecture and gardens contributed to the advancement of the vibrant cultural life of Kyoto.

Rather than prioritizing accurate anatomical renderings, artists sought to capture the ""life energy"" of their subjects. This exhibition explores sophisticated decorative arts that depict figures dating to late imperial China, from the Song (960–1279) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Over this thousand-year period, images of humans, legendary figures, and immortals frequently appeared. The first gallery focuses on children, a ubiquitous and long-standing motif expressing the cultural importance of offspring. The second gallery displays scenes from idealized daily life, historical novels, and legends. Various religious figures from Buddhism and Daoism are presented in the third gallery.

2019,"The Facade Commission: Wangechi Mutu,The NewOnes, will free Us","September 9, 2019–November 1, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/facade-commission-wangechi-mutu,"The NewOnes, will free Us , by Kenyan-American artist Wangechi Mutu, inaugurates an annual commission to animate The Met's historic facade. Designed by Richard Morris Hunt and completed in 1902, the facade features four niches that were always intended to house free-standing sculptures, but have long lain empty. In filling them now with Mutu's extraordinary sculptures, the Museum brings to fruition a dream 117 years in the making. Mutu has responded to The Met's invitation by creating four bronze sculptures, individually titled The Seated I , II , III , and IV (2019). As with all of her work, these pieces engage in a critique of gender and racial politics that is as pointed as it is poetic and fantastic. With The NewOnes, will free Us , the artist has reimagined a motif common to the history of both Western and African art: the caryatid, a sculpted figure, almost always female, meant to serve as a means of either structural or metaphorical support. Whether carved out of wood for the prestige stool of a West African king or chiseled out of marble for a building on the Athenian Acropolis, the caryatid has always been confined to her role as load-bearer. For her part, Mutu stages a feminist intervention, liberating the caryatid from her traditional duties and her secondary status. Mutu does so, moreover, in the context of a Neoclassical facade, whose original architects sought to convey a far more conservative set of values. Simultaneously celestial and humanoid, each sculpture is unique, with individualized hands, facial features, ornamentation, and patination. Mutu's embellishments take a great deal of inspiration from customs practiced by specific groups of high-ranking African women. The horizontal and vertical coils that sheathe the figures' bodies, functioning as garment and armor all in one, reference beaded bodices and circular necklaces, while the polished discs set into different parts of the sculptures' heads allude to lip plates. Belonging to no one time or place, Mutu's hybrid figures are invariably stately, resilient, and self-possessed. They announce their authority and autonomy. Appearing to have recently arrived on the facade of The Met, they are the ""new ones"" who bring word of new ideas and new perspectives. The NewOnes, will free Us constitutes one of Mutu's most important and remarkable bodies of work to date, the culmination of two decades of sustained artistic experimentation and rigorous research into the relationship between power, culture, and representation.

2019,The Art of London Firearms,"January 29, 2019–October 25, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/london-firearms,"This exhibition explores a fascinating and often overlooked chapter in the art of European gunmaking, presenting a selection of fourteen important London-made firearms drawn from the Museum's collection, many of which have rarely or never been exhibited. Focusing on pistols—a strength of the Museum's British firearms collection—rather than long guns, it includes works dating from the mid-eighteenth to the early nineteenth century, among them highly embellished arms made for the Prince of Wales, later George IV (1762–1830) and his circle. Thematically organized around technological innovations and style, the exhibition is the first in the United States to examine the art of the London gunmaker. Beginning around 1780, a small group of talented gunmakers set up workshops on the outskirts of the London city center. Their names, Durs Egg, John Manton, and Samuel Brunn, among others, are largely unknown to those outside the arms and armor field. But their contributions to the art of firearms are almost without parallel. In fierce competition with one another for lucrative commissions, fame, and prestige, they brought the flintlock gun to a level of refinement never before seen. They all but discarded extraneous decoration, and instead favored the development of elegant yet ergonomic designs incorporating new technologies that served to enhance accuracy, handling, and speed. Through this exploratory process, a beautiful and distinctly British style of firearm was born. The gunmakers of this ""Augustine age,"" as one writer of the period defined it, fittingly earned a devoted following among the British royal family and the aristocracy, in addition to great fame throughout Europe."

The designs for the fabrics and wallpapers, based on Wright’s architectural vocabulary and inspired by specific buildings, were featured in a sample book, Schumacher's Taliesin Line of Decorative Fabrics and Wallpapers Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (1955).

Taking its title from Zarina's 1999 suite of thirty-six woodcuts , this exhibition features art that explores the meanings of ""home"" and ""place"" in our increasingly interwoven globe, whether by necessity or choice. Contemporary art and earlier avant-garde movements of modern art do not have a single origin, nor do they develop in isolation. Since the 1940s, artists have sought new forms of expression as they have lived through culturally transformative events, from devastating wars, social and humanitarian injustices, and mass migration to economic and environmental change. These histories continue to impact and inform the art of our time. In this thematic display, works are united by shared engagements with language, architecture, space, and politics that demonstrate the movement of ideas and identities across cultural and national boundaries. The resulting visual conversations emphasize the significance of parallel artistic impulses in the world and over time, while remaining attentive to the specific local and historical circumstances of their making. #HomeIsaForeignPlace"

Such lavish public spending and display of precious metals was considered an expression of power. Many princes also believed that the possession of artistic and technological innovations conveyed status, and these objects were often prominently showcased in elaborate court entertainments, which were characteristic of the period. Making Marvels explores the complex ways in which the wondrous items collected by early modern European princes, and the contexts in which they were displayed, expressed these rulers' ability to govern. Approximately 170 objects—including clocks, automata, furniture, musical instruments, jewelry, paintings, sculptures, print media, and more—from both The Met collection and over fifty lenders worldwide are featured. Visitors will discover marvelous innovations that engaged and delighted the senses of the past, much like twenty-first-century technology holds our attention today—through suspense, surprise, and dramatic transformations. Accompanied by a catalogue and picture album published by The Met. #MakingMarvels ""A trove of impossibly opulent European objects. . . .

2019,"Pen, Lens & Soul: The Story of The Beautiful Project","December 6, 2019–February 24, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/the-beautiful-project,"Pen, Lens & Soul: The Story of The Beautiful Project presents over a decade of work by image makers who create spaces for Black girls and women to express their power and beauty. Founded in 2004, The Beautiful Project is a North Carolina–based collective of Black artists, scholars, and educators who act as agitators encouraging Black girls and women to be the caretakers of their needs and images. Through writing, photography, and programming, The Beautiful Project cultivates Black identity, fosters sisterhood, and embraces Black girls within a loving community. Amid widespread misunderstanding and misuse of Black likenesses in the media and in the world at large, the members of The Beautiful Project amplify the voices of Black girls and women, encouraging them to own conversations that are often about them but without them. The works in this exhibition are both a creative celebration and a summons: inspiring viewers to honor the dynamism of Black girls and women, and at the same time, urging them to confront pervasive misrepresentations of Black culture. The Beautiful Project is the house that Black girls and women built. The Beautiful Project is one of twenty-one arts and cultural organizations—including The Metropolitan Museum of Art—that form the Collaborative for Creative Practice and Social Justice . The members of this group work in and with communities across New York City and in North Carolina to promote positive social change. The Met is proud to host this exhibition. This exhibition was curated by Jamaica Gilmer, Khayla Deans, Pamela Thompson, and Erin Stephens of The Beautiful Project, with profound support from The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The exhibition is made possible by The William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust."
2019,Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints: The Wrightsman Legacy,"November 15, 2019–February 16, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/drawings-and-prints-november-wrightsman-legacy,"In a relationship with The Met that spanned more than six decades, Charles and Jayne Wrightsman enriched the lives of countless visitors through extraordinary gifts. This exhibition will celebrate the couple's generosity with a selection of drawings, prints, and books from the Wrightsman Collection, as well as a few works acquired with the Wrightsman Fund. Some of the earliest gifts focus on designs for architecture and interior design. On display is a small sampling of several hundred drawings, covering a broad range of subjects from designs for palaces and gardens to furniture, costumes, and textiles. The Wrightsmans went on to build a collection of figural drawings, with a focus on eighteenth-century France. Jayne in particular had a strong interest in artworks by women, as well as themes of exoticism and travel. Artists she favored include Jean Étienne Liotard, Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, and Gabriel de Saint-Aubin. Her interests also extended into the nineteenth century, represented here by watercolors by John Frederick Lewis, a British artist who lived in Egypt, and by an outstanding group of portraits drawn by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Her gift of both paintings and etchings by James Tissot, a Frenchman who spent part of his career in London, allows for comparison of his garden subjects across media. Additional installations celebrating gifts from the Wrightsman Collection may be seen in the European Paintings Galleries (gallery 632 ) and in the Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts (gallery 545 ).

2019,Epic Abstraction: Pollock to Herrera,"December 17, 2018–February 4, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/epic-abstraction-pollock-herrera,"Epic Abstraction is closed, but many of the works remain on view in galleries 917–925 . We felt the moral crisis of a world in shambles, a world devastated by a great depression and a fierce world war, and it was impossible at that time to paint the kind of painting that we were doing—flowers, reclining nudes, and people playing the cello. . . . So we actually began . . . as if painting were not only dead but had never existed. —Barnett Newman, 1967 Artist and theorist Barnett Newman mythologized the origins of the movement known as Abstract Expressionism as having emerged in the 1940s from a tabula rasa, or ""blank slate."" In truth, the work of the Abstract Expressionists, a group of New York–based painters and sculptors bound loosely by shared interests in mythic themes and European Surrealism, developed within a particular set of historical conditions— particularly emigration from and exchange with Europe, Mexico, Latin America, and Asia, and the city's emergence as a global economic capital. Newman's account rightly suggests the feeling widespread among artists of the period that traditional easel painting and figurative sculpture could no longer adequately convey the modern human condition in the wake of unprecedented misery and devastation, including the 1945 atomic bombings in Japan authorized by the U.S. government. In this context, artists such as Newman, Jackson Pollock, and others came to believe that abstract styles—often executed on a grand scale—most meaningfully expressed contemporary states of being. Epic Abstraction features large-scale abstract painting and sculpture from the 1940s through the early twenty-first century, drawn primarily from The Met collection. Abstract Expressionism serves as the springboard for a thematic installation that intersperses enduring icons with works by lesser-known artists and debuts new acquisitions. Many of the artists represented here worked in large formats because they sought not only to have the scope to fully explore line, color, shape, and texture, but also to evoke expansive—""epic""—ideas and subjects, including time, history, the body, and existential concerns of the self.

Painted portraits, luminous landscapes, and interior narratives that pulse with psychological tension join the exhibition from more than two dozen lenders. Swiss-born and Paris-educated, Vallotton (1865–1925) created lasting imagery of fin-de-siècle Paris. Witness to the radical aesthetics that gripped Paris in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Vallotton developed his own singular voice. Today we recognize him as a distinctive artist of his generation. His lampooning wit, subversive satire, and wry humor is apparent everywhere in his artistic production. Vallotton's trenchant woodcuts of the 1890s solidified his reputation as a printmaker of the first rank while boldly messaging his left-wing politics. For the first time ever, this exhibition displays Picasso's legendary portrait of Gertrude Stein, from The Met collection, alongside Vallotton's rendering of this formidable collector, which was painted a year later. Vallotton finished his portrait in a matter of weeks and gave it to Gertrude Stein.

2019,The Renaissance of Etching,"October 23, 2019–January 20, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/renaissance-of-etching,"The history of printmaking has been punctuated by moments of great invention that have completely changed the course of the medium. The beginning of etching in Europe in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries—when the technique moved out of the workshop of armor decorators and into those of printmakers and painters—represents one of those pivotal moments. Etching, essentially drawing on the surface of a metal plate, had an ease that opened the door for all kinds of artists to make prints. The pioneers of the medium included some of the greatest painters of the Renaissance, such as Albrecht Dürer, Parmigianino, and Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This exhibition traces the first sixty years of the etched print (circa 1490 to circa 1560), from its emergence in the workshop of the German printmaker and armor decorator Daniel Hopfer to the years when a range of artists from Germany, Flanders, Italy, and France began experimenting with etching. Approximately 125 etchings, produced by both renowned and lesser-known artists, are displayed alongside a number of drawings, printing plates, illustrated books, and armor. Accompanied by a catalogue. #RenaissanceofEtching ""A fascinating look at how etching revolutionised 16th-century printmaking. . . . a cornucopia of rare delights""— Financial Times The exhibition is made possible by the Diane W. and James E.

In 1947—after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs—the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. This exhibition features nearly one hundred cards produced between the 1880s and the 1950s. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. Produced using various types of media, from photography to lithography, the cards feature legends of the game as well as lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

Throughout an accomplished career that spans more than fifty years, Celmins has sustained a practice of deep focus and extraordinary skill in a wide range of media. Celmins bases her exquisitely wrought paintings, sculpture, drawings, and prints on the world around us—sometimes through direct observation, but more often mediated by photography. Whether her sources are quotidian objects from her first studio in Venice, California, photographs of the Pacific Ocean taken at the local pier, or reproductions from newspapers, magazines, scientific exploration and inquiry, the resulting work possesses a magical verisimilitude.

Discovered in 1863 and on view in an exhibition at The Met Cloisters, the Colmar Treasure revives the memory of a once-thriving Jewish community that was scapegoated and put to death when the Plague struck the region with devastating ferocity in 1348–49. A generous loan of the Musée de Cluny, Paris, the Colmar Treasure is displayed alongside select works from The Met Cloisters and little-known Judaica from collections in the United States and France. Although the objects on view are small in scale and relatively few in number, the ensemble overturns conventional notions of medieval Europe as a monolithic Christian society.

Including 180 objects selected from some thirty public and private collections in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, The Last Knight will explore how Maximilian's unparalleled passion for the trappings and ideals of knighthood served his boundless worldly ambitions, imaginative stratagems, and resolute efforts to forge a lasting personal and family legacy. This exhibition features many works of art on view outside Europe for the first time, including Maximilian's own sumptuous armors that highlight his patronage of the greatest European armorers of his age, as well as related manuscripts, paintings, sculpture, glass, tapestry, and toys, all of which emphasize the emperor's dynastic ambitions and the centrality of chivalry at the imperial court and beyond.

2019,Another World Lies Beyond: Chinese Art and the Divine,"August 24, 2019–January 5, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/another-world-lies-beyond-chinese-art-and-the-divine,"Premodern China teemed with images of the divine. From the humblest printed image of the Stove God, hung in the kitchen, to the most lavish ritual painting created for a Buddhist monastery, people filled their world with objects that served as portals to realms beyond their own and to forces beyond their control. This exhibition presents a rich display of such images—mostly drawn from the Museum's collection—ranging from serene, monochrome Buddhist paintings to raucous, colorful sculptures of popular deities. The exhibition begins with galleries devoted to Buddhist art. Arising in India and brought to China by traveling teachers around two thousand years ago, Buddhism became a major force in Chinese spiritual life and a wellspring of popular and liturgical imagery. One gallery is devoted to the arts of Daoism, a native religion that draws on both ancient Chinese philosophy and popular religious practice. The final galleries are devoted to the divine presence in the home and in the countryside, as expressed in popular deities and fantastical creatures. An important characteristic of spiritual life in premodern China was its fluidity. This can be seen throughout the exhibition in the easy mixing of ideas and iconographies, with Daoist figures appearing in Buddhist paintings, for instance. In the same spirit, the presence of artworks from Persia, Tibet, Japan, and Korea demonstrates how readily deities, teachings, and artistic styles crossed political and cultural boundaries in the premodern world. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. This installation features Brewster & Company  (1810–1923) and the Carriage Era in New York City. On display are selected drawings, prints, photographs, and paintings—and a historic carriage model—that highlight the rise and success of New York's most celebrated carriage manufacturer against the backdrop of the cultural and economic development and urban expansion of New York City during the Gilded Age. Brewster & Co. was founded in New Haven by James Brewster (1788–1866), and by 1827 the firm had opened a repository in New York. Between 1850 and 1903, the company produced no fewer than 13,347 distinct carriage designs. Among the thousands of clients who bought and commissioned carriages from Brewster & Co. were many notable New Yorkers and other famous Gilded Age personalities, such as Henry Clay Frick, J. P. Morgan, William Rockefeller, and Louis Comfort Tiffany. The Brewster & Co. drawings archive was donated to the Museum by its last owner and Met trustee, William Brewster (1866–1949). Drawings and other works by the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright are on view, including several from a recent acquisition that significantly expanded the Museum's holdings of the architect's work. A related exhibition, Frank Lloyd Wright Textiles: The Taliesin Line, 1955–62 , will simultaneously be on display in the Antonio Ratti Textile Center . Also on view are an assortment of color prints by Anton Maria Zanetti, which demonstrate the historical and aesthetic interest in chiaroscuro woodcuts in eighteenth-century Venice, and a selection of large-scale drawings or cartoon fragments from sixteenth-century Italy. Rounding out the rotation are seventeenth- through twenty-first-century images of insects whose high-keyed colors make the depicted creatures seem to fly off the page, and a selection of drawings and prints reproduced through a process called counterproofing, a lesser-known technique used by artists to develop and disseminate their work."

Throughout the Islamic world, calligraphy embellishes the surfaces of objects large and small—from architecture to items of daily use—in styles that range from the elegant, refined, and eminently readable to the decorative, abstract, and barely legible. No other culture has explored the decorative and creative possibilities of the written word as extensively. This exhibition examines the interplay between writing and picturing in Islamic calligraphy and explores the inherent tension between textual design, decoration, readability, and verbal clarity in some four dozen examples of Islamic calligraphy from The Met collection. These works, created between the ninth century and the present, include works on paper and parchment; ceramics; metalwork and coins; and a carpet. The presentation includes a selection of modern and contemporary works by artists from Iran and Pakistan who use the written word as their primary mode of artistic expression.

Drawn from American collections and The Met's own holdings, the exhibition showcases some thirty works—figural sculpture, painted barkcloth, rare featherwork, and more—dating from the late eighteenth to the nineteenth century. The presentation offers visitors an opportunity to understand a core principle of Pacific art: the divine is not abstract but very much alive in nature. Atea is a Polynesian cosmological term that refers to the moment when it was believed that light first sparked forth after many eons of thick, engulfing darkness, resulting in the birth of the first generation of gods. Across Polynesia, ritual artifacts were created for the powerful chiefs who descended from these gods and who, as political and religious leaders, were imbued with the spiritual essence ( mana ) of their forbears. Prestige items such as feather cloaks and headdresses reinforced their status and reputation and asserted genealogical connections with their divine ancestors. These spectacular works illustrate the vitality of the natural world and highlight the ways in which Polynesian elites strategically channeled its material potency to enhance their own spiritual efficacy.

Honorific Chants for Hawai'ian Gods Presented in the exhibition gallery, this chant invokes two pairs of principal gods ( akua ) of Hawai'i: first, Ku, who is associated with governance and warfare, and his counterpart Lono, who brings the rains that encourage fertility; and second, KÄne, usually associated with the land, and Kanaloa, who presides over the ocean. Polynesian gods are not easily classifiable and are inherently multiple. The four in this chant derive from earlier deities found in Tahiti and Tonga who are known by similar names: Tu and Rongo, and Tane and Ta'aroa (Tonga: Tangaloa).

Art is an annual celebration of achievement in the arts in New York City public schools. This juried exhibition of the work of talented young artists showcases the creativity of 122 prekindergarten through twelfth grade students from all five boroughs, including students from District 75, a citywide district serving students with disabilities. The exhibition consists of paintings, prints, sculptures, photographs, mixed-media works, collages, drawings, and video. Each work of art demonstrates personal expression, imaginative use of media, the results of close observation, and an understanding of artistic processes. Dedicated art teachers support students' creativity and help them look closely to respond to their worlds through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and learn to harness their imaginations for artistic expression. A panel of arts specialists from the Department of Education and Studio in a School selected 323 semifinalists from more than 1,200 submissions. A jury of distinguished members of the New York City arts community, including staff of The Met, chose the works on display in P.S. Art 2019 .

2019,Leonardo da Vinci'sSaint Jerome,"July 15–October 6, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/leonardo-da-vinci-st-jerome,"To commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), The Met presents the artist’s painting Saint Jerome Praying in the Wilderness (begun around 1483), a special loan from the Vatican Museums. The exquisitely rendered work represents Jerome (A.D. 347–420), a major saint and theologian of the Christian Church. The scene is based on the story of his later life, which he spent as a hermit in the desert, according to the thirteenth-century Golden Legend . The unfinished painting provides viewers with an extraordinary glimpse into Leonardo's creative process, and a close examination of the paint surface reveals the presence of his fingerprints. The display of this monumental masterpiece pays homage to one of the most renowned geniuses of all time. ""A single-painting show of one of the most rawly emotional images in the Leonardo canon.""— New York Times This presentation at The Metropolitan Museum of Art has been organized with the generous collaboration of the Vatican Museums.

2019,Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll,"April 8–October 1, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/play-it-loud,"For the first time, a major museum exhibition examines the instruments of rock and roll. One of the most important artistic movements of the twentieth century, rock and roll's seismic influence was felt across culture and society. Early rock musicians were attracted to the wail of the electric guitar and the distortion of early amplifiers, a sound that became forever associated with rock music and its defining voice. Rock fans have long been fascinated with the instruments used by musicians. Many have sought out and acquired the exact models of instruments and equipment used by their idols, and spent countless hours trying to emulate their music and their look. The instruments used in rock and roll had a profound impact on this art form that forever changed music. The exhibition is co-organized with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and will present approximately 130 instruments alongside posters and costumes. Many of rock's most celebrated and recognized instruments are featured, representing artists across generations and subgenres. In addition to institutional and private collectors, many musicians are lending their performance and recording instruments. This playlist includes songs that represent the artists and instruments from the exhibition. Selected by Met Curator Jayson Kerr Dobney.

The exhibition brings together fifty-seven works by Mukherjee and explores the artist's longstanding engagement with fiber, along with her significant forays into ceramic and bronze towards the middle and latter half of her career. A committed sculptor who worked intuitively, Mukherjee explored the divide between figuration and abstraction. Nature was her primary inspiration, and she was further informed by her enthusiasm for Indian historic sculpture, modern design, and local crafts and textile traditions. Phenomenal Nature highlights the radical intervention Mukherjee made in her adaptation of crafting techniques with a modernist formalism. Accompanied by a catalogue .

Korea's cross-cultural contacts with neighbors near and far—especially China—have played a significant role in shaping its rich and diverse artistic traditions. Korean culture has also provided important inspiration to others, notably Japan. This exhibition offers a window into the essentials of the peninsula's creative output, past and present. Arranged in loosely chronological order are major works from The Met collection, augmented by significant loans from the National Museum of Korea. The pieces represent key genres and themes of Korean art; they include strikingly modern-looking pots and glittering jewelry from ancient burial sites; exquisite Buddhist icons; refined green-glazed celadon; understated white porcelain; and pictorial images, both sophisticated and whimsical, that feature a range of motifs from nature. The Met received its first gift of a Korean object in 1893. The Arts of Korea Gallery opened in 1998.

2019,"Ragnar Kjartansson,Death Is Elsewhere","May 30–September 2, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/ragnar-kjartansson-death-is-elsewhere,"As part of a new series of contemporary installations, The Met presents the world premiere of a major new work: Death Is Elsewhere (2019), a seven-channel video installation by the acclaimed Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson. Provocatively rethinking the possibilities for performance and video art, Kjartansson makes work in which he simultaneously evokes Romantic clichés while using irony, nihilism, and absurdity to undermine them. Death Is Elsewhere is the most recent in a series of durational performance-based works in which a single song is performed without beginning or end, in a nearly continuous loop. Filmed around the time of the summer solstice shortly after midnight in southern Iceland, Death Is Elsewhere features male and female pairs of twins (Kjartansson's frequent collaborators: the musicians Gyða and Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir, and Aaron and Bryce Dessner of the National), performing the title song against a landscape of sublime natural beauty, as they move continuously across seven screens, encircling the viewer. Despite the idyllic setting and dulcet song, the specter of death is omnipresent.

2019,We Found Us: Expanding the Walls 2019,"July 19–August 30, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/we-found-us,"On display is work by the fifteen artists in the 2018–19 cohort of Expanding the Walls: Making Connections Between Photography, History, and Community , an annual, eight-month residency at The Studio Museum in Harlem in which New York City–area high-school participants explore the history and techniques of photography. This exhibition reflects on the artists' personal and collective development and captures what they find significant in their daily lives. It demonstrates their shared interest in storytelling, technical experimentation, and the possibilities of photography as a channel for expression. We Found Us is a declaration born as the artists grappled with themes of selfhood and community, and found new perspectives on the world through their cameras and one another. Each artist takes command of their own narrative and shows us what we would otherwise not see. Since the founding of the Expanding the Walls program in 2001, the archive of the Harlem photographer James VanDerZee (1886–1983), housed at the Studio Museum, has been a catalyst for the participants' critical reflections on the representation of culture and community. In this exhibition, selections from the archive are on view alongside the artists' works, which place a contemporary lens on VanDerZee's visual commentary on community, history, and representation. (There are also works by VanDerZee in The Met collection, althought they are not currently on view.) We Found Us: Expanding the Walls 2019 is organized by Alex Adams, Curatorial Fellow at The Studio Museum in Harlem, and Mia Matthias, Joint Curatorial Fellow at The Studio Museum in Harlem and The Museum of Modern Art, with Ginny Huo, Senior Coordinator, Teen Programs, The Studio Museum in Harlem, and the 2018–19 Expanding the Walls participants.

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor—the Museum's curator of prints and photographs—the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. This exhibition features nearly one hundred cards produced between the 1880s and the 1950s. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. Produced using various types of media, from photography to lithography, the cards feature legends of the game as well as lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game.

2019,Oliver Beer:Vessel Orchestra,"July 2–August 11, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/oliver-beer-vessel-orchestra,"Composed of thirty-two sculptures, utilitarian containers, and decorative objects from the Museum's collection, Vessel Orchestra is the first sound-based installation commissioned by The Met. British artist Oliver Beer (born 1985) uses microphones and speakers to amplify and shape the ambient tones resonating within each vessel, transforming them into an arresting and unexpectedly versatile musical instrument. With objects ranging in origin from ancient Persia to modern America, this exhibition links works of art across historical periods and cultures, creating an audible portrait of The Met collection. Drawing on his musical training, Beer creates artworks that reveal the hidden properties of objects, bodies, and architectural sites. His social and familial relationships often become the blueprint for multidisciplinary works that engage with both intimate and universal concerns, such as the personal and cultural meanings invested in the things we possess. During Museum hours, a pre-programmed audio interface plays a new composition written by Beer, animating the vessels in real time—""player-piano style."" On Friday evenings, a diverse group of guest musicians activate the vessels, performing new compositions and improvisations in a series of intimate concerts.

But when it comes to the wonders of brush and ink, [real] landscape is no match for painting! —Dong Qichang (1555–1636) About a thousand years ago, the Chinese landscape painter Guo Xi posed the question, ""In what does a gentleman's love of landscape consist?"" This question is at the heart of the exhibition, which explores the many uses of landscape in the Chinese visual arts. This exhibition, which showcases more than 120 Chinese landscape paintings in four rotations, offers insights into the tradition, revealing distinctions between types of landscape that might not be obvious at first glance. What appears to be a simple mountain dwelling, for example, turns out to be the villa of the painter's friend, encoding a wish for his happy retirement. Similarly, what seems at first to be a simple study in dry brushwork turns out to be an homage to an old master, an expression of reverence for what has come before. Drawn primarily from The Met's holdings and supplemented by a dozen private loans, the presentation is augmented by decorative art objects with landscape themes.

2019,Siah Armajani: Follow This Line,"February 20–June 2, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/siah-armajani-follow-this-line,"Featuring nearly one hundred works made over the past sixty years, Siah Armajani: Follow This Line is the first major U.S. retrospective of preeminent Iranian-American artist Siah Armajani (born 1939). While still a student and activist in 1950s Tehran, Armajani created collages that masqueraded as political broadsheets and presaged many of the concerns now associated with American conceptual art. The exhibition includes many never-before-seen and recently rediscovered works from the 1960s and '70s, as well as the artist's landmark Dictionary for Building series (1974–75), composed originally of thousands of small-scale architectural maquettes. The exhibition peers through Armajani's eyes as he develops an aesthetic of exile, and asks what the role of public art in America might be today. Rather than focus on those works that explicitly address exile and associated themes, Siah Armajani: Follow This Line identifies tactics that define this aesthetic across the trajectory of Armajani's practice. For the first time, the artist's sculptures, installations, and drawings are understood as props for public performances. Across the exhibition, props for official or institutionalized speech—such as the sermon, the political speech, the religious recitation, and the broadcast radio program—compete with props for performing magic spells, veiled calls for political activism, and poetry readings. Accompanied by a catalogue . To coincide with the exhibition at The Met Breuer, Public Art Fund presents a re-staging of Armajani's seminal public art installation Bridge Over Tree (1970).

In order to personify peoples they knew little about, European artists invented a visual vocabulary to depict America, creating long-lasting stereotypes such as the ""Indian princess"" and the ""noble savage."" Artists working in the United States in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries inherited these conventions and adapted them to create romanticized images of Native peoples existing apart from the modern world. Facilitated by the advent of photography in the mid-nineteenth century, Indigenous Americans were increasingly subjected to ethnographic documentation, as their destiny as a ""doomed race"" was widely accepted by Euro-Americans. Nostalgia for the ""vanishing Indian"" also motivated artists at the turn of the twentieth century to look to Native cultures, notably in the Southwest, for authentic American subject matter. Occurring amid colonization, genocide, dispossession, and cultural destruction, these artistic encounters with Indigenous America reveal little about the realities of Native life; instead, they reflect the attitudes and anxieties of the artists and societies that produced them. Featuring more than forty works from The Met collection, this exhibition includes drawings, prints, watercolors, photographs, and popular ephemera from the seventeenth to the early twentieth century. To add a broader perspective to this complex historical imagery, contemporary artist Wendy Red Star (Apsáalooke/Crow) was invited to author interpretative labels for the works of her choosing, included on the exhibition object pages below. Red Star draws on her cultural heritage as well as archival research to create art in a variety of media that questions, often in humorous and provocative ways, stereotypes of Native Americans. Artistic Encounters with Indigenous America complements the exhibition Art of Native America: The Charles and Valerie Diker Collection , on view at The Met Fifth Avenue from October 4, 2018, through October 6, 2019.

2019,Monumental Journey: The Daguerreotypes of Girault de Prangey,"January 30–May 12, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/monumental-journey-girault-de-prangey-daguerreotypes,"In 1842, artist, architectural historian, archaeologist, and pioneer photographer Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey (1804–1892) embarked on a three-year photographic excursion throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, and he returned to France with more than one thousand daguerreotypes—an unparalleled feat in the history of photography. Among the images he created are the earliest surviving photographs of Greece, Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, and Jerusalem and among the first daguerreotypes depicting Italy. A trailblazer of the daguerreotype process, Girault used oversize plates and innovative formats to produce what is today the world's oldest photographic archive—all in the service of a brand-new type of archaeological fieldwork. This exhibition, the first in the United States devoted to Girault, and the first to focus on his Mediterranean journey, features approximately 120 of his daguerreotypes, supplemented by examples of his graphic work—watercolors, paintings, and his lithographically illustrated publications.

2019,The Secret Life of Textiles: The Milton Sonday Archive,"December 18, 2017–May 5, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/secret-life-of-textiles,"Textile scholar Milton Sonday is one of the world's foremost authorities on the structures of handmade fabrics, particularly woven textiles and lace. Hired in 1962 by the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C., as a draftsman for a project on Precolumbian ceramics, he was promoted shortly thereafter to assistant curator responsible for carpets. In 1967, he joined the curatorial staff of the Cooper Hewitt Museum. Early in his career, Sonday began to put his artistic skills to use in creating legible and visually pleasing technical drawings that express the weaves of patterned textiles. He went on to teach seminars on fabric analysis, developing various methods that enabled students (even those who claimed they ""couldn't draw"") to re-create and therefore understand the structures of historical textiles. This installation includes a selection of Sonday's studies of lace structures and couched embroidery, loom models for patterned weaves, and diagrams made from classic handwoven textiles. His clear, comprehensible, and attractive drawings and models have become more than didactic tools. The wit and imagination evident in Sonday's choices of materials and colors and the skill with which the works are made has inspired delight and appreciation over the years. In 2012, Sonday donated his research archive to the Antonio Ratti Textile Center at The Met. The first portions are available for study now while the Museum continues cataloguing and processing this treasure trove. Sonday has generously given his time to assist with the ongoing organization of the archive, which spans his entire career and includes his most recent projects."

Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. This installation features works that commemorate the five-hundredth anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci. Highlights include four rare drawings by the artist, as well as a number of works on paper related to his legacy. A magnificent series of knots by Albrecht Dürer, which are believed to depend on designs by Leonardo, are also on view with a selection of late fifteenth-century engravings. The installation additionally presents a cross-section of the department's collection of Harper's -related material, including illustrations for Harper's Weekly by the preeminent American artist Winslow Homer and political cartoonist Thomas Nast. A large selection of works by the leading designer of American posters, Edward Penfield, who worked almost exclusively for the publishing house of Harper & Brothers, is also on view.

2019,Lucio Fontana: On the Threshold,"January 23–April 14, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/lucio-fontana-on-the-threshold,"The first major survey of Lucio Fontana (1899–1968) in the United States in more than forty years, this exhibition reexamines the career of one of the most innovative artists of the twentieth century. The Argentine-Italian artist is widely known for his Cuts series, slashed paintings that became symbols of the postwar era. The exhibition presents extraordinary examples of this iconic body of work. It also explores Fontana's beginnings as a sculptor, including his exquisite work in ceramic, as well as his pioneering environments, contextualizing the radical gesture of his Cuts as part of the artist's broader search to integrate the space of art and the space of the viewer.

2019,Julio Le Parc 1959,"December 4, 2018–February 24, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/julio-le-parc-1959,"The first solo exhibition in a New York museum of Argentinian artist Julio Le Parc celebrates the artist's extraordinary gift to The Met of twenty-four works, and also marks the occasion of the artist's ninetieth birthday. Featuring over fifty works, Julio Le Parc 1959 presents a substantial, never-before-seen selection of gouaches from one of the most prolific and transformative years in the artist's career. Born in Mendoza, Argentina, in 1928, Le Parc studied under Lucio Fontana during the 1940s and engaged with abstract avant-garde movements in Buenos Aires. In 1958, Le Parc moved to Paris, where his encounter with Op artists, such as Victor Vasarely, had an important influence on his art. The series of gouaches Le Parc started that year—intimate yet methodical studies of form and color—illuminates his interest in developing geometric abstraction by incorporating movement through variations, sequences, and progressions. This work anticipates his founding role in Kinetic art during the 1960s, when he made paintings and sculptures with movable parts by incorporating mirrors, motors, and electric light. Aiming to make art more accessible and politically relevant, Le Parc also experimented with projected lights in darkened rooms, adding a sense of playfulness and encouraging viewer participation. To represent this achievement, the exhibition also includes the kinetic painting Form in Contortion over Weft (1966) and the immersive installation Continual Light Cylinder (1962/2018).

2019,Dangerous Beauty: Medusa in Classical Art,"February 5, 2018–February 24, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/dangerous-beauty,"Beginning in the fifth century B.C., Medusa—the snaky-haired Gorgon whose gaze turned men to stone—became increasingly anthropomorphic and feminine, undergoing a visual transformation from grotesque to beautiful. A similar shift in representations of other mythical female half-human beings—such as sphinxes, sirens, and the sea monster Scylla—took place at the same time. Featuring sixty artworks, primarily from The Met collection, this exhibition explores how the beautification of these terrifying figures manifested the idealizing humanism of Classical Greek art, and traces their enduring appeal in both Roman and later Western art. The connection between beauty and horror, embodied above all in the figure of Medusa, outlived antiquity, fascinating and inspiring artists through the centuries. Medusa became the archetypical femme fatale, a conflation of femininity, erotic desire, violence, and death. Along with the beautiful Scylla, she foreshadows the conceit of the seductive but threatening female that emerges in the late nineteenth century in reaction to women's empowerment.

2019,Discoveries @30,"November 18, 2018–February 18, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/discoveries-at-30,"Last year marked the thirtieth anniversary of Discoveries , The Met's program for children and adults with developmental and learning disabilities and those on the autism spectrum, along with their friends and families. This exhibition includes works of art created by program participants during the past year, as well as descriptions of the workshops in which they were made. The works demonstrate the themes and materials that inspire these artists to explore, experiment, and develop their creativity. Discoveries educators and volunteers aim to create an engaging and comfortable environment for families to enjoy art at The Met, to make their own art, and to socialize with one another. Since its inception, Discoveries has included participants of all ages, with and without disabilities. Many families have been participating for years, and new families join regularly. Last year, nearly 650 people participated in the twenty-four Discoveries workshops. Discoveries is an important part of The Met's century-long history of creating accessible opportunities for people with disabilities to engage with art. Following the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and subsequent legislation ensuring access to public education for children with disabilities, in the late 1970s, educator Charles Steiner piloted programs inviting adults and children with developmental disabilities to visit the Museum and connect with art. Based on this pioneering initiative, The Met published resources on accessibility and programming for museum and classroom educators and established Disabled Visitor Services, a division of The Met's Education Department. Today, the Access division continues to implement programs and accommodations for people with disabilities in the Museum and beyond its walls and to ensure that all Met programs are designed inclusively. In addition, this team leads Museum-wide initiatives supporting The Met's commitment to accessibility and inclusion of people with disabilities. Congratulations to all the artists whose works are on view in this exhibition and many thanks to all Discoveries participants, educators, and volunteers for contributing to this inclusive and creative community.

In celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the artist's birth, this exhibition explores an innovative and little-studied aspect of Tintoretto's portraiture: small-scale, informal portrait heads characterized by immediacy, intense observation, and startling modernity. These works capture both the appearance and the spirit of the sitter, and are painted with the artist's famous prestezza, or quickness. The exhibition brings together for the first time approximately ten portrait studies from European and American museums and private collections, drawing them into a larger discussion of the artist's portraiture and approach to painting.

2019,Christmas Tree and Neapolitan Baroque Crèche,"November 20, 2018–January 6, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/christmas-tree,"The Met continues a longstanding holiday tradition with the presentation of its Christmas tree, a favorite of both New Yorkers and visitors from around the world. The magnificently lit, twenty-foot blue spruce looms over a vivid eighteenth-century Neapolitan Nativity scene, enshrined in an abundant array of lifelike figures with silk-robed angels hovering above. The scene describes in detail the Mediterranean harbor town's multicultural society. The installation is set in front of the eighteenth-century Spanish choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid in the Museum's Medieval Sculpture Hall. Recorded Christmas music adds to the enjoyment of the holiday display. Please note: There are no tree-lighting ceremonies scheduled this year due to the European Paintings Skylights Project . However, seasonal music will continue to be played in the gallery throughout the installation. #MetChristmasTree The exhibit of the crèche is made possible by gifts to The Christmas Tree Fund and the Loretta Hines Howard Fund.

The collection was originally assembled in the early twentieth century by Dr. Frederick Malling Pedersen (1869–1947) of New York. It later passed by descent to Mr. and Mrs. Morris, who have seen to its care and restoration. Key works include a rare complete armor ( gusoku ) by Bamen Tomotsugu (active eighteenth century); a blade attributed to Fusamune of SÅshÅ« (active late fifteenth–early sixteenth century) with mounting; and a helmet ( kawari-kabuto ) in the shape of a wave (seventeenth century, restored 2015). The gift of choice objects from the collection represents a significant addition to the Museum's holdings of Japanese arms and armor, which are the most comprehensive of their kind outside of Japan."
2019,Delacroix,"September 17, 2018–January 6, 2019",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/delacroix,"French painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) was one of the greatest creative figures of the nineteenth century. Coming of age after the fall of Napoleon, he reconnected the present to the past on his own terms. Delacroix produced an extraordinarily vibrant body of work, setting into motion a cascade of innovations that changed the course of art. This exhibition is the first comprehensive retrospective devoted to this amazing artist ever held in North America. The exhibition, a joint project with the Musée du Louvre, illuminates Delacroix's restless imagination through more than 150 paintings, drawings, prints, and manuscripts—many never before seen in the United States. It unfolds chronologically, encompassing the rich variety of themes that preoccupied the artist during his more than four decades of activity, including literature, history, religion, animals, and nature. Through rarely seen graphic art displayed alongside such iconic paintings as Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi (1826), The Battle of Nancy (1831), Women of Algiers in Their Apartment (1834), and Medea about to Kill Her Children (1838), this exhibition explores an artist whose protean genius set the bar for virtually all other French painters.

Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy is the first major exhibition to tackle this perennially provocative topic. It traces the simultaneous development of two kinds of art about conspiracy. The first half of the exhibition comprises works by artists who hew strictly to the public record, uncovering hidden webs of deceit—from the shell corporations used by New York's largest private landlord, interconnected networks encompassing politicians, businessmen, and arms dealers. In the second part, other artists dive headlong into the fever dreams of the disaffected, creating fantastical works that nevertheless uncover uncomfortable truths in an age of information overload and weakened trust in institutions. Featuring seventy works by thirty artists in media ranging from painting and sculpture to photography, video, and installation art, from 1969 to 2016, Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy presents an alternate history of postwar and contemporary art that is also an archaeology of our troubled times. Accompanied by a catalogue . #MetArtandConspiracy Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy is accompanied by the exhibition Jane and Louise Wilson: Stasi City , on view at The Met Fifth Avenue from September 18, 2018, through March 31, 2019.

2020,In Praise of Painting: Dutch Masterpieces at The Met,"October 16, 2018–September 17, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/in-praise-of-painting-dutch-masterpieces,"Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century—the Golden Age of Rembrandt, Hals, and Vermeer—have been a highlight of The Met collection since the Museum's founding purchase in 1871. This exhibition brings together some of the Museum's greatest paintings to present this remarkable chapter of art history in a new light. Through sixty-seven works of art organized thematically,In Praise of Paintingorients visitors to key issues in seventeenth-century Dutch culture—from debates about religion and conspicuous consumption to painters' fascination with the domestic lives of women. The exhibition provides a fresh perspective on the canon and parameters of the Dutch Golden Age by uniting paintings from Benjamin Altman's bequest, the Robert Lehman Collection, and the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection. Works typically displayed separately in the Museum's galleries—such as Rembrandt'sGerard de Lairesseand Lairesse's ownApollo and Aurora—are presented side by side, producing a visually compelling narrative about the tensions between realism and idealism during this period. The presentation also provides the opportunity to conserve and display rarely exhibited paintings, including Margareta Haverman'sA Vase of Flowers—one of only two known paintings by the artist and the only painting by an early modern Dutch woman currently in The Met collection. The exhibition takes its title from one of the period's major works of art theory, Philips Angel'sThe Praise of Painting(1642), a pioneering defense of realism in art.

While one gallery will highlight the creation of still life and genre painting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, two others will provide an overview of oil sketches from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, leading up to the Museum's unsurpassed collection of works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. A large gallery will display portraiture in the Grand Siècle, juxtaposing outstanding paintings by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck with Charles Le Brun’s monumental family portrait of the banker Everhard Jabach. The eighteenth-century French galleries will take up such themes as the study of expression, François Boucher and the decorative arts, and the role of female artists, who finally found a place in the academy. The Met’s unique collection of French Neoclassical painting, dominated by gifts fromJayne Wrightsman, will be installed with sculptured busts by Jean Antoine Houdon of the essential figures of the Enlightenment: Denis Diderot and Voltaire. These are just a few examples of the novel themes that will be on display.

2020,Spring Blossoms: Margaret Armstrong’s Decorated Publishers’ Bindings,"February 15, 2020–January 31, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/spring-blossoms,"Margaret Armstrong (1867–1944) was an author, book cover designer, field collector, and botanical illustrator. She was among the most influential designers of her time and a source of inspiration for other female book cover designers and future generations including Amy M. Sacker, Lee Thayer, and Marion Louise Peabody. Armstrong’s first book cover design,Sweet Williamby Marguerite Bouvet, was published in 1890. Early in her career she met reluctance placing her designs with publishers, as the field of book cover design was dominated by men. To surmount this challenge, she signed her early submissions “M.N. Armstrong.” However, the years 1892–93 were groundbreaking for women book cover designers: several important exhibitions in prominent clubs and at the World’s Columbian Exposition featured women designers and paved the way for the success they enjoyed during the next decades. As Armstrong’s career as a book designer progressed, her designs became more fluid and individualized, reflecting the book’s subject. With her increasingly colorful, striking book covers, she was in demand as a designer and worked for twenty-one different publishers producing approximately 270 book cover designs. Spring Blossoms: Margaret Armstrong’s Decorated Publishers’ Bindings, Watson Library’s first online exhibition, presents a selection of books with covers designed by Armstrong from the 1890s to 1913. The exhibit highlights four themes: designs that invoke the patterns of stained glass, the lavender series of publications by Myrtle Reed, designs featuring flowers and plant forms, and lesser-known book covers.

2020,Relative Values: The Cost of Art in the Northern Renaissance,"August 7, 2017–January 23, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/relative-values-northern-renaissance,"Bringing together sixty-two masterpieces of sixteenth-century northern European art from The Met collection and one important loan, this exhibition revolves around questions of historical worth, exploring relative value systems in the Renaissance era. Organized in six sections—raw materials, virtuosity, technological advances, fame, market, and paragone—tapestry, stained and vessel glass, sculpture, paintings, precious metal-work, and enamels are juxtaposed with pricing data from sixteenth-century documents. What did a tapestry cost in the sixteenth century? Goldsmiths' work? Stained glass? How did variables like raw materials, work hours, levels of expertise and artistry, geography, and rarity, affect this? Did production cost necessarily align with perceived market valuation in inventoried collections? Who assigned these values? By exploring different sixteenth-century yardsticks of gauging worth, by probing extrinsic versus intrinsic value, and by presenting works of different media and function side-by-side, the exhibition captures a sense of the splendor and excitement of this era.

Recent archaeological, ethnohistorical, and art-historical research has deepened our understanding of indigenous Caribbean concepts of ritual knowledge, ceremonial performance, and political power. Artists in the region—which includes the modern Antilles archipelago and countries such as Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Honduras—sought to express the distinct force of their deities and ancestors, known to the Taínos as zemí (or cemí ), which pervaded the environment and was crucial to the foundation of communities. Pendants and other objects worn and used by leaders in ceremonies were created from imported luxury materials and share a formal grammar that is inextricably linked with deeply rooted mythological narratives. Works of art on view in the exhibition, largely drawn from The Met collection, celebrate the region's ancestral traditions, and a twentieth-century painting by an Afro-Caribbean artist explores their enduring legacy. ""A concentrated showcase at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that plunges visitors into a sea of archipelagic thinking.

2020,Chinese Painting and Calligraphy Up Close,"December 21, 2020–June 27, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/chinese-painting-calligraphy,"Close looking is at the heart of Chinese painting and calligraphy. In premodern China, painters and calligraphers learned by copying, a practice that required heightened observation of details. In the process, they also learned how to look—how to detect fine distinctions of ink tone, saturation, and line. Only after years of this type of intense looking could a person be considered a true expert. This exhibition will encourage such looking by displaying original artworks alongside photographic enlargements of their details. The magnified details draw attention to subtleties of brushwork, texture, and line that may escape a viewer at first glance. Ultimately, the enlargements draw us back to the original, revealing the rewards that close looking can offer. On view in two rotations will be some of the most celebrated works of Chinese painting and calligraphy from the Museum's collection. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate in large batches his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards—along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters—to The Met. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. This exhibition features over one hundred cards produced between the 1890s and the 1950s. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era, at the turn of the nineteenth century, through the golden age and modern era of the sport. Produced using various types of media—from photography to lithography—the cards feature legends of the game as well as lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

2020,"Pictures, Revisited","October 19, 2020–May 9, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/pictures-revisited,"A deep dive into The Met's rich collection of contemporary photography, Pictures, Revisited reassesses the legacy of visual appropriation at the Museum and beyond. The images in this show are snipped from magazines, staged, or copied outright from other artworks. Like the works in this exhibition, the show itself is a sort of remix; on the occasion of the Museum's 150th anniversary, it provocatively expands and reimagines The Met's landmark 2009 exhibition, The Pictures Generation, 1974–1984— the first major museum initiative to trace the evolution of visual appropriation through a network of practitioners including Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, and Sarah Charlesworth. Drawing equally from pop culture and art history, the artists manipulated familiar photographs, ads, logos, and tropes, decontextualizing and reusing this imagery to upend traditional notions of authorship. Responding to a media landscape ever more saturated with images, they reached a conclusion which in our digital age seems obvious: where pictures once documented reality, they now replace it. More than a decade later, Pictures, Revisited situates their work in an expanded field. Of the tightly knit group of American artists who formed the first ""Pictures Generation,"" five are represented here. They appear alongside key predecessors and contemporaries, as well as artists for whom the ""Pictures"" approach was a critical influence. This exhibition considers the many legacies of appropriation, manifest at times in collage and archival projects, and in theatrically staged photographs that test the limits of cliché. Seen together, these strategies suggest an antidote to the anxiety of influence—that fear that there is nothing new under the sun. In a world increasingly mediated by images, perhaps there is no such thing as an original picture."

Monkman, born in Canada in 1965, is a Cree artist widely known for his provocative interventions into Western European and American art history. He explores themes of colonization, sexuality, loss, and resilience—the complexities of historic and contemporary Indigenous experiences—across a variety of mediums, including painting, film, performance, and installation. Monkman's gender-fluid alter ego, Miss Chief Eagle Testickle, often appears in his work as a time-traveling, shape-shifting, supernatural being who reverses the colonial gaze to challenge received notions of history and Indigenous peoples. This installation is part of a new series of contemporary commissions at The Met in which the Museum invites artists to create new works of art inspired by the collection, establishing a dialogue between the artist's work, the collection, the space, and audiences.

The works, most of which have never been seen by the public, date from the 1860s to the early 1890s, a period that coincides with many significant cultural achievements in New York, including the founding of The Met in 1870. The exhibition in the American Wing evokes the scrupulously restored interiors of the Wigmores' home (which was constructed in 1883), with period light fixtures and reproduction wallpapers of the same era. The objects in this exhibition are promised gifts from Museum trustee Barrie Wigmore and his wife, Deedee Wigmore, in honor of The Met's 150th Anniversary. MetCollects This episode of MetCollects traces the inventiveness across painting and decorative arts that typified the Aesthetic Movement in nineteenth-century America, as seen in five works recently given by Barrie and Deedee Wigmore."
2020,Art and Peoples of the Kharga Oasis,"October 11, 2017–April 11, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/kharga-oasis,"In 1908, The Metropolitan Museum of Art began to excavate late-antique sites in the Kharga Oasis, located in Egypt's Western Desert. The Museum's archaeologists uncovered two-story houses, painted tombs, and a church. They also retrieved objects that reveal the multiple cultural and religious identities of the people who lived in the region. The finds represent a society between the third and seventh centuries A.D., a time of transition between the Roman and early Byzantine periods, which integrated Egyptian, Greek, and Roman culture and art. This exhibition features some thirty works from these excavations. By grouping objects according to the archaeological context in which they were discovered, the exhibition explores the interpretation of ancient identities and artifacts and shows how archaeological documentation can assist in understanding an object's original function. On view are ceramics, ostraca (pottery shards used as writing surfaces), jewelry from burials, glassware, coins, copies of frescoes with early Christian images, and early twentieth-century site photography.

Accompanied by a number of textiles from across South Asia, the artworks illustrate the hero Rama's rescue of his beloved wife, Sita, after her abduction by Ravana, an evil demon with ten heads. The philosophical dimension of the story finds visual expression in these images, particularly its interest in the themes of morality, kingship, and Rama's status as a divine manifestation (or avatar) of Vishnu. Highlights include an important group of paintings from the early Punjab Hills Shangri/Mankot Ramayana series. The exhibition is made possible by The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Foundation Fund."

Art is an annual celebration of achievement in the arts in New York City public schools. This juried exhibition of work created during the 2019–20 school year by talented young artists showcases the creativity of 122 prekindergarten through grade 12 students from all five boroughs, including students from District 75, a citywide district serving students with disabilities. The exhibition consists of paintings, prints, sculptures, photographs, mixed-media works, collages, and drawings. Each work of art demonstrates personal expression, imaginative use of media, the results of close observation, and an understanding of artistic processes. Dedicated art teachers encourage students to look closely at their worlds and respond creatively through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and learn to harness their imaginations for artistic expression. A panel of arts specialists from the New York City Department of Education and Studio in a School selected 348 semifinalists from more than 1,100 submissions. A jury of distinguished members of the City's arts community, including staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, chose the works on display in P.S. Art 2020 . This exhibition celebrates the students' journeys and discoveries from early childhood to young adulthood. Interspersed among the actual works on view are a number of labels with reproductions of works—a poignant reminder of the challenges faced in the creation of this year's exhibition due to the global pandemic. We will place the missing works on view as we receive them. See also the exhibition catalogue produced by Studio in a School.

2020,About Time: Fashion and Duration,"October 29, 2020–February 7, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/about-time,"Watch a longer preview featuring additional looks from the exhibition on The Met's YouTube channel. The Costume Institute's 2020 exhibition traces a century and a half of fashion—from 1870 to the present—along a disruptive timeline, on the occasion of The Met's 150th anniversary. Employing Henri Bergson's concept of la durée (duration), it explores how clothes generate temporal associations that conflate past, present, and future. Virginia Woolf serves as the ""ghost narrator"" of the exhibition. The timeline unfolds in two adjacent galleries fabricated as enormous clock faces and organized around the principle of 60 minutes of fashion. Each ""minute"" features a pair of garments, with the primary work representing the linear nature of fashion and the secondary work its cyclical character. To illustrate Bergson’s concept of duration—of the past co-existing with the present—the works in each pair are connected through shape, motif, material, pattern, technique, or decoration. For example, a black silk faille princess-line dress from the late 1870s is paired with an Alexander McQueen ""Bumster"" skirt from 1995. A black silk satin dress with enormous leg-o’-mutton sleeves from the mid-1890s is juxtaposed with a Comme des Garçons deconstructed ensemble from 2004. All of the garments are black to emphasize changes in silhouette, except at the conclusion of the show, where a white dress from Viktor & Rolf’s spring/summer 2020 haute couture collection, made from upcycled swatches in a patchwork design, serves as a symbol for the future of fashion with its emphasis on community, collaboration, and sustainability.

2020,Kyoto: Capital of Artistic Imagination,"July 24, 2019–January 31, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/kyoto-capital-artistic-imagination,"Focusing on the main turning points in the cultural history of Kyoto from ancient to modern times, Kyoto: Capital of Artistic Imagination places special emphasis on the decorative arts. Over eighty masterworks of lacquers, ceramics, metalwork, and textiles from The Met collection, including a number of recently acquired works of contemporary art are showcased. A selection of over fifty paintings by masters of various schools are accompanied by a rare fourteenth-century suit of armor, splendid export lacquers made for the European market in the late sixteenth-century, exquisite eighteenth-century Noh robes, as well as austere tea wares with characteristic imperfections. Heian-kyÅ, as modern-day Kyoto was once referred to, became the seat of the imperial court in 794 and remained the capital of Japan until 1869, when the court was transferred to Tokyo. The rich cultural heritage of this city was profoundly shaped by the presence of the emperor and aristocrats as well as high-ranking warriors, varied groups of artists, and literati working in the orbit of the palace. Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, Noh theaters, workshops of painters and lacquer artists, ceramic kilns, textile shops, a flourishing tea culture, and bustling market districts, as well as supremely elegant architecture and gardens contributed to the advancement of the vibrant cultural life of Kyoto. The exhibition is made possible by The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Foundation Fund."
2020,Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints: Anniversary Highlights,"October 8, 2020–January 18, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/drawings-prints-anniversary-highlights,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. During the celebration of the Museum's 150th anniversary, the Department of Drawings and Prints will present four thematic installations that take an in-depth look at the fabric of its collections. This second installation showcases a selection of highlights from the departmentâs collection of one million works on paper. The drawings, prints, and books on view were created over the span of five hundred years by celebrated artists active in Europe and the United States. Arranged in the gallery by theme, the works represent subjects that have been favored in the art world for centuries. Their juxtapositionâsuch as the pairing of still lifes by Paul CÃ©zanne and Pablo Picasso, or head studies by Leonardo da Vinci and Ford Madox Brownâexposes how different artists engaged with a particular theme. Together, the selected works tell a larger story about the evolution and continuities in our appreciation of composition, style, technique, and subject matter."
2020,Gerhard Richter: The Birkenau Paintings,"September 5, 2020–January 18, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/birkenau-gerhard-richter,"Gerhard Richter: The Birkenau Paintings is a focused installation that brings together the four canvases of this landmark series alongside an earlier work in glass, Mirror, Blood Red (1991). The German artist Gerhard Richter (b. 1932) has explored the material, conceptual, and historical implications of painting throughout his six-decade career. The Birkenau series (2014) encapsulates his long-standing interest in art's ability to reckon with issues of identity and collective memory, particularly in the context of post–World War II Germany. In the four paintings, Richter confronts the question of whether—and how—art is able to address the history of the Holocaust. The Birkenau paintings are based on four photographs secretly taken in the death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau. After a yearlong attempt to render the photographic images, Richter gradually veiled his initial figurative drawings with color, scouring each coat of paint with a squeegee to produce layered, ruptured surfaces. The canvases' distinctive facture and relatively subdued palette reflect the artist's conscious struggle to address the grim documents of historical trauma while curtailing the spectacular nature of the reproduced photograph. Together, the series holds in tension the complex relationship between representation and abstraction, and the opposing forces of destruction and reconstruction. #MetRichter The Birkenau series served as the conceptual core of Gerhard Richter: Painting After All , at The Met Breuer, which marked the first time the works had been seen in the United States. That exhibition was originally scheduled to run from March 4 through July 5, 2020, but closed on March 12 due to the COVID-19 crisis. 360º Exhibition Walkthrough | Gerhard Richter: Painting After All Learn more about how the Birkenau series was created in the Gerhard Richter: Painting After All Primer .

Rather than prioritizing accurate anatomical renderings, artists sought to capture the ""life energy"" of their subjects. This exhibition explores sophisticated decorative arts that depict figures dating to late imperial China, from the Song (960–1279) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Over this thousand-year period, images of humans, legendary figures, and immortals frequently appeared. The first gallery focuses on children, a ubiquitous and long-standing motif expressing the cultural importance of offspring. The second gallery displays scenes from idealized daily life, historical novels, and legends. Various religious figures from Buddhism and Daoism are presented in the third gallery. Some of the objects in this exhibition are recognized masterpieces, while others are little known and have not been on view for decades. Mainly drawn from The Met collection, this exhibition showcases diverse media, including textiles, lacquer, jade, ceramic, wood, bamboo, and metalwork.

2020,James Nares:Street,"November 27–29, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/street,"When I first proposed it in 2011, I talked about this film as being something to be viewed 'a hundred years from now.' Well, it's nine years since then, and I don't think any of us could have imagined the city that we find ourselves in at this present moment. The contemplation of times past has always sparked my imagination. The actualité and other 'document' films from the previous century were a large source of my original inspiration. It pleases me to find my own film falling into line with them. The city as presented in Street seems very distant now but I have every hope that we will soon return to some semblance of it. I have spoken of this film as a love poem to New York and that still holds true. —James Nares From Friday, November 27, through Sunday, November 29, starting at 5 p.m., The Met will project James Nares's mesmerizing Street (2011) onto the Museum's south-facing wall in Central Park (just inside the park entrance at 80th Street), marking the first time the Museum has projected a work of art onto its exterior. The sixty-one-minute video, filmed in New York City in September 2011 as a love letter to British-born Nares' adoptive home, decelerates the hubbub of the city to hypnotic effect. The artist recorded sixteen hours of footage from a moving car using a massive high-speed camera, and then greatly slowed the source material, editing down the results to one hour of steady, continuous motion and scoring it with music for twelve-string guitar composed and performed by the artist's friend Thurston Moore, co-founder of Sonic Youth. On view within Central Park and outside The Met—two icons of New York City—the projection of Nares' languorous tribute to the bustling metropolis will offer a restorative respite from the eerie quiet caused by the impact of the global pandemic. As Central Park goers pass by and encounter the spellbinding video of New York City's streets and its people, it can briefly offer a moving reminder of the fabric of urban life that makes New York so unique and a hope for a return to the vibrant energy. Please note that projections are weather permitting. An inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public space where people are present.

2020,"The Facade Commission: Wangechi Mutu,The NewOnes, will free Us","September 9, 2019–November 1, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/facade-commission-wangechi-mutu,"The NewOnes, will free Us , by Kenyan-American artist Wangechi Mutu, inaugurates an annual commission to animate The Met's historic facade. Designed by Richard Morris Hunt and completed in 1902, the facade features four niches that were always intended to house free-standing sculptures, but have long lain empty. In filling them now with Mutu's extraordinary sculptures, the Museum brings to fruition a dream 117 years in the making. Mutu has responded to The Met's invitation by creating four bronze sculptures, individually titled The Seated I , II , III , and IV (2019). As with all of her work, these pieces engage in a critique of gender and racial politics that is as pointed as it is poetic and fantastic. With The NewOnes, will free Us , the artist has reimagined a motif common to the history of both Western and African art: the caryatid, a sculpted figure, almost always female, meant to serve as a means of either structural or metaphorical support. Whether carved out of wood for the prestige stool of a West African king or chiseled out of marble for a building on the Athenian Acropolis, the caryatid has always been confined to her role as load-bearer. For her part, Mutu stages a feminist intervention, liberating the caryatid from her traditional duties and her secondary status. Mutu does so, moreover, in the context of a Neoclassical facade, whose original architects sought to convey a far more conservative set of values. Simultaneously celestial and humanoid, each sculpture is unique, with individualized hands, facial features, ornamentation, and patination. Mutu's embellishments take a great deal of inspiration from customs practiced by specific groups of high-ranking African women. The horizontal and vertical coils that sheathe the figures' bodies, functioning as garment and armor all in one, reference beaded bodices and circular necklaces, while the polished discs set into different parts of the sculptures' heads allude to lip plates. Belonging to no one time or place, Mutu's hybrid figures are invariably stately, resilient, and self-possessed. They announce their authority and autonomy. Appearing to have recently arrived on the facade of The Met, they are the ""new ones"" who bring word of new ideas and new perspectives. The NewOnes, will free Us constitutes one of Mutu's most important and remarkable bodies of work to date, the culmination of two decades of sustained artistic experimentation and rigorous research into the relationship between power, culture, and representation.

Lawrence's ""Struggle"" was originally conceived as sixty 12-by-16-inch tempera paintings, spanning subjects from European colonization to World War I. It was intended to depict, in the artist's words, ""the struggles of a people to create a nation and their attempt to build a democracy."" He ultimately completed thirty panels representing historical moments from 1775 through 1817—from Patrick Henry's famous ""liberty"" speech to westward expansion. Lawrence painted the series at the height of the Cold War and Joseph McCarthy's Red Scare, which also coincided with landmark Civil Rights actions, such as the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that called for the desegregation of public schools. These events deeply informed the artist's approach to the historical subjects. In his ambitious portrayal of these episodes as inherently contested and diverse, Lawrence foregrounds the experiences of women and people of color. Most panels are accompanied by quotations from historical texts. This more inclusive representation of the nation's past is no less relevant today, and Lawrence's prescient visual reckoning with American history remains profoundly resonant with ongoing issues of racial justice and national identity. Accompanied by a catalogue.

2020,Sahel: Art and Empires on the Shores of the Sahara,"January 30–October 26, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/sahel-art-empire-sahara,"From the first millennium, the western Sahel—a vast region in Africa just south of the Sahara Desert that spans what is today Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger—was the birthplace of a succession of influential polities. Fueled by a network of global trade routes extending across the region, the empires of Ghana (300–1200), Mali (1230–1600), Songhay (1464–1591), and Segu (1640–1861) cultivated an enormously rich material culture. Sahel: Art and Empires on the Shores of the Sahara is the first exhibition of its kind to trace the legacy of those mighty states and what they produced in the visual arts. The presentation brings into focus transformative developments—such as the rise and fall of political dynasties, and the arrival of Islam—through some two hundred objects, including sculptures in wood, stone, fired clay, and bronze; objects in gold and cast metal; woven and dyed textiles; and illuminated manuscripts. Highlights include loans from the region's national collections, such as a magnificent ancient terracotta equestrian figure (third through eleventh century) from the Institut de Recherches en Sciences Humaines, University of Niamey, Niger; and a dazzling twelfth-century gold pectoral that is a Senegalese national treasure, from the Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire, in Dakar. The exhibition and its accompanying catalogue bring together an array of cross-disciplinary perspectives on the material, with contributions from historians specializing in oral traditions and Islam, archaeologists, philosophers, and art historians.

2020,The Art of London Firearms,"January 29, 2019–October 25, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/london-firearms,"This exhibition explores a fascinating and often overlooked chapter in the art of European gunmaking, presenting a selection of fourteen important London-made firearms drawn from the Museum's collection, many of which have rarely or never been exhibited. Focusing on pistols—a strength of the Museum's British firearms collection—rather than long guns, it includes works dating from the mid-eighteenth to the early nineteenth century, among them highly embellished arms made for the Prince of Wales, later George IV (1762–1830) and his circle. Thematically organized around technological innovations and style, the exhibition is the first in the United States to examine the art of the London gunmaker. Beginning around 1780, a small group of talented gunmakers set up workshops on the outskirts of the London city center. Their names, Durs Egg, John Manton, and Samuel Brunn, among others, are largely unknown to those outside the arms and armor field. But their contributions to the art of firearms are almost without parallel. In fierce competition with one another for lucrative commissions, fame, and prestige, they brought the flintlock gun to a level of refinement never before seen. They all but discarded extraneous decoration, and instead favored the development of elegant yet ergonomic designs incorporating new technologies that served to enhance accuracy, handling, and speed. Through this exploratory process, a beautiful and distinctly British style of firearm was born. The gunmakers of this ""Augustine age,"" as one writer of the period defined it, fittingly earned a devoted following among the British royal family and the aristocracy, in addition to great fame throughout Europe."
2020,Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints: Collectors' Collections,"February 19–October 5, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/collectors-collections,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. During the celebration of the Museum's 150th anniversary, the Department of Drawings and Prints will present four thematic installations that take an in-depth look at the fabric of its collections. This installation is devoted to several transformative gifts made by passionate collectors who focused their attention on specific artists, schools, or genres. The display includes works from the modern and contemporary print collections given by Leslie and Johanna Garfield; William S. Lieberman; and Florence and Joseph Singer. Silhouettes bequeathed by Mary Martin, a collector of cut-paper works, and Biedermeier-era greeting cards made of precious materials, donated by Jean Riddell, will be joined by rare fifteenth-century German prints, from the collection of James Clark McGuire, and a bequest of etchings by Rembrandt and other masters from Henry Osborne and Louisine Havemeyer. Other donated collections on view include a selection of botanical watercolors and stained glass designs by Maitland, Margaret Neilson, and Helen Armstrong; a group of British drawings and watercolors given by George D. Pratt and Walter C. Baker; and examples of Mary Cassatt's color aquatints collected by Arthur and Paul J. Sachs."

2020,"Frank Lloyd Wright Textiles: The Taliesin Line, 1955–60","May 20, 2019–September 27, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/frank-lloyd-wright-textiles,"In 1955, the renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959) launched the first commercial venture of his long and eminent career, designing a line of affordable home products for the general consumer. The designs for the fabrics and wallpapers, based on Wright’s architectural vocabulary and inspired by specific buildings, were featured in a sample book, Schumacher's Taliesin Line of Decorative Fabrics and Wallpapers Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (1955). Only 100 copies of the sample book were printed and were available exclusively to authorized dealers. This installation presents the book and nine examples of the fabric it introduced, all from the original line produced by F. Schumacher and Co. In addition to the textiles that reflect the signature Wright aesthetic, the installation also includes two examples of Wright-designed wooden vases that were made in a very limited number and never reached the open market, and a 1954 photograph of the architect by Yosuf Karsh. Related Content Designed and built between 1912 and 1914, the Frank Lloyd Wright Room epitomizes Wright's concept of ""organic architecture,"" in which the building, setting, interior, and furnishings are inextricably related."

2020,Celebrating the Year of the Rat,"January 17–August 27, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/year-of-the-rat,"The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating twelve-year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac. The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century B.C. and became firmly established by the first century A.D. The twelve animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of the people born in that year. This Lunar New Year, which begins on January 25, 2020, is the Year of the Rat, a creature characterized as active, agile, and smart. Rats and mice, traditionally considered the same animal in East Asia, have been close companions of humans since ancient times. The earliest written Chinese character for ""rat"" ( shu ) appears on a thirteenth-century-B.C. oracle bone. In the Chinese classics, rats figure prominently in political satires, such as the poem ""Big Rat"" in the Book of Songs , which dates from the eleventh to the seventh century B.C. As the Chinese lunar calendar was adopted by Korea, Japan, Mongolia, and Vietnam, the rat became a popular motif in various artistic media, as well as in folklore throughout East Asia. To celebrate the Year of the Rat, the Museum is pleased to present a selection of remarkable works from its collection that illustrate the animal's ubiquitous presence in people's daily lives. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2020,Home Is a Foreign Place: Recent Acquisitions in Context,"April 9, 2019–March 12, 2020 (intended closing date June 21, 2020)–March 12, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/home-is-a-foreign-place,"Home Is a Foreign Place highlights recent acquisitions of modern and contemporary art from Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and South and Southeast Asia, alongside works by iconic modern American artists from The Met collection. Taking its title from Zarina's 1999 suite of thirty-six woodcuts , this exhibition features art that explores the meanings of ""home"" and ""place"" in our increasingly interwoven globe, whether by necessity or choice. Contemporary art and earlier avant-garde movements of modern art do not have a single origin, nor do they develop in isolation. Since the 1940s, artists have sought new forms of expression as they have lived through culturally transformative events, from devastating wars, social and humanitarian injustices, and mass migration to economic and environmental change. These histories continue to impact and inform the art of our time. In this thematic display, works are united by shared engagements with language, architecture, space, and politics that demonstrate the movement of ideas and identities across cultural and national boundaries. The resulting visual conversations emphasize the significance of parallel artistic impulses in the world and over time, while remaining attentive to the specific local and historical circumstances of their making. #HomeIsaForeignPlace"

This exhibition will highlight and celebrate some fifty works from the gift, ranging from a drawing by French artist Théodore Géricault from about 1818—the earliest work in the show—to a wax-crayon drawing done in 2019 by a friend of Rubenstein, artist Dorothea Rockburne."
2020,Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe,"November 25, 2019–March 1, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/making-marvels-science-splendor,"Between 1550 and 1750, nearly every royal family in Europe assembled vast collections of valuable and entertaining objects. Such lavish public spending and display of precious metals was considered an expression of power. Many princes also believed that the possession of artistic and technological innovations conveyed status, and these objects were often prominently showcased in elaborate court entertainments, which were characteristic of the period. Making Marvels explores the complex ways in which the wondrous items collected by early modern European princes, and the contexts in which they were displayed, expressed these rulers' ability to govern. Approximately 170 objects—including clocks, automata, furniture, musical instruments, jewelry, paintings, sculptures, print media, and more—from both The Met collection and over fifty lenders worldwide are featured. Visitors will discover marvelous innovations that engaged and delighted the senses of the past, much like twenty-first-century technology holds our attention today—through suspense, surprise, and dramatic transformations.

Founded in 2004, The Beautiful Project is a North Carolina–based collective of Black artists, scholars, and educators who act as agitators encouraging Black girls and women to be the caretakers of their needs and images. Through writing, photography, and programming, The Beautiful Project cultivates Black identity, fosters sisterhood, and embraces Black girls within a loving community. Amid widespread misunderstanding and misuse of Black likenesses in the media and in the world at large, the members of The Beautiful Project amplify the voices of Black girls and women, encouraging them to own conversations that are often about them but without them. The works in this exhibition are both a creative celebration and a summons: inspiring viewers to honor the dynamism of Black girls and women, and at the same time, urging them to confront pervasive misrepresentations of Black culture. The Beautiful Project is the house that Black girls and women built. The Beautiful Project is one of twenty-one arts and cultural organizations—including The Metropolitan Museum of Art—that form the Collaborative for Creative Practice and Social Justice . The members of this group work in and with communities across New York City and in North Carolina to promote positive social change. The Met is proud to host this exhibition. This exhibition was curated by Jamaica Gilmer, Khayla Deans, Pamela Thompson, and Erin Stephens of The Beautiful Project, with profound support from The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

This exhibition will celebrate the couple's generosity with a selection of drawings, prints, and books from the Wrightsman Collection, as well as a few works acquired with the Wrightsman Fund. Some of the earliest gifts focus on designs for architecture and interior design. On display is a small sampling of several hundred drawings, covering a broad range of subjects from designs for palaces and gardens to furniture, costumes, and textiles. The Wrightsmans went on to build a collection of figural drawings, with a focus on eighteenth-century France. Jayne in particular had a strong interest in artworks by women, as well as themes of exoticism and travel. Artists she favored include Jean Étienne Liotard, Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, and Gabriel de Saint-Aubin. Her interests also extended into the nineteenth century, represented here by watercolors by John Frederick Lewis, a British artist who lived in Egypt, and by an outstanding group of portraits drawn by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Her gift of both paintings and etchings by James Tissot, a Frenchman who spent part of his career in London, allows for comparison of his garden subjects across media.

2020,Epic Abstraction: Pollock to Herrera,"December 17, 2018–February 4, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/epic-abstraction-pollock-herrera,"Epic Abstraction is closed, but many of the works remain on view in galleries 917–925 . We felt the moral crisis of a world in shambles, a world devastated by a great depression and a fierce world war, and it was impossible at that time to paint the kind of painting that we were doing—flowers, reclining nudes, and people playing the cello. . . . So we actually began . . . as if painting were not only dead but had never existed. —Barnett Newman, 1967 Artist and theorist Barnett Newman mythologized the origins of the movement known as Abstract Expressionism as having emerged in the 1940s from a tabula rasa, or ""blank slate."" In truth, the work of the Abstract Expressionists, a group of New York–based painters and sculptors bound loosely by shared interests in mythic themes and European Surrealism, developed within a particular set of historical conditions— particularly emigration from and exchange with Europe, Mexico, Latin America, and Asia, and the city's emergence as a global economic capital. Newman's account rightly suggests the feeling widespread among artists of the period that traditional easel painting and figurative sculpture could no longer adequately convey the modern human condition in the wake of unprecedented misery and devastation, including the 1945 atomic bombings in Japan authorized by the U.S. government. In this context, artists such as Newman, Jackson Pollock, and others came to believe that abstract styles—often executed on a grand scale—most meaningfully expressed contemporary states of being. Epic Abstraction features large-scale abstract painting and sculpture from the 1940s through the early twenty-first century, drawn primarily from The Met collection. Abstract Expressionism serves as the springboard for a thematic installation that intersperses enduring icons with works by lesser-known artists and debuts new acquisitions. Many of the artists represented here worked in large formats because they sought not only to have the scope to fully explore line, color, shape, and texture, but also to evoke expansive—""epic""—ideas and subjects, including time, history, the body, and existential concerns of the self.

Painted portraits, luminous landscapes, and interior narratives that pulse with psychological tension join the exhibition from more than two dozen lenders. Swiss-born and Paris-educated, Vallotton (1865–1925) created lasting imagery of fin-de-siècle Paris. Witness to the radical aesthetics that gripped Paris in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Vallotton developed his own singular voice. Today we recognize him as a distinctive artist of his generation. His lampooning wit, subversive satire, and wry humor is apparent everywhere in his artistic production. Vallotton's trenchant woodcuts of the 1890s solidified his reputation as a printmaker of the first rank while boldly messaging his left-wing politics. For the first time ever, this exhibition displays Picasso's legendary portrait of Gertrude Stein, from The Met collection, alongside Vallotton's rendering of this formidable collector, which was painted a year later. Vallotton finished his portrait in a matter of weeks and gave it to Gertrude Stein.

2020,The Renaissance of Etching,"October 23, 2019–January 20, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/renaissance-of-etching,"The history of printmaking has been punctuated by moments of great invention that have completely changed the course of the medium. The beginning of etching in Europe in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries—when the technique moved out of the workshop of armor decorators and into those of printmakers and painters—represents one of those pivotal moments. Etching, essentially drawing on the surface of a metal plate, had an ease that opened the door for all kinds of artists to make prints. The pioneers of the medium included some of the greatest painters of the Renaissance, such as Albrecht Dürer, Parmigianino, and Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This exhibition traces the first sixty years of the etched print (circa 1490 to circa 1560), from its emergence in the workshop of the German printmaker and armor decorator Daniel Hopfer to the years when a range of artists from Germany, Flanders, Italy, and France began experimenting with etching. Approximately 125 etchings, produced by both renowned and lesser-known artists, are displayed alongside a number of drawings, printing plates, illustrated books, and armor.

In 1947—after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs—the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards in large batches, along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters, to the Museum. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. This exhibition features nearly one hundred cards produced between the 1880s and the 1950s. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century through the golden age and modern era of the sport. Produced using various types of media, from photography to lithography, the cards feature legends of the game as well as lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

Throughout an accomplished career that spans more than fifty years, Celmins has sustained a practice of deep focus and extraordinary skill in a wide range of media. Celmins bases her exquisitely wrought paintings, sculpture, drawings, and prints on the world around us—sometimes through direct observation, but more often mediated by photography. Whether her sources are quotidian objects from her first studio in Venice, California, photographs of the Pacific Ocean taken at the local pier, or reproductions from newspapers, magazines, scientific exploration and inquiry, the resulting work possesses a magical verisimilitude.

Discovered in 1863 and on view in an exhibition at The Met Cloisters, the Colmar Treasure revives the memory of a once-thriving Jewish community that was scapegoated and put to death when the Plague struck the region with devastating ferocity in 1348–49. A generous loan of the Musée de Cluny, Paris, the Colmar Treasure is displayed alongside select works from The Met Cloisters and little-known Judaica from collections in the United States and France. Although the objects on view are small in scale and relatively few in number, the ensemble overturns conventional notions of medieval Europe as a monolithic Christian society. The exhibition points to both legacy and loss, underscoring the prominence of the Jewish minority community in the tumultuous fourteenth century and the perils it faced.

On view only at The Met, The Last Knight coincides with the five-hundredth anniversary of Maximilian's death, and is the most ambitious North American loan exhibition of European arms and armor in decades. Including 180 objects selected from some thirty public and private collections in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, The Last Knight will explore how Maximilian's unparalleled passion for the trappings and ideals of knighthood served his boundless worldly ambitions, imaginative stratagems, and resolute efforts to forge a lasting personal and family legacy. This exhibition features many works of art on view outside Europe for the first time, including Maximilian's own sumptuous armors that highlight his patronage of the greatest European armorers of his age, as well as related manuscripts, paintings, sculpture, glass, tapestry, and toys, all of which emphasize the emperor's dynastic ambitions and the centrality of chivalry at the imperial court and beyond.

2020,Another World Lies Beyond: Chinese Art and the Divine,"August 24, 2019–January 5, 2020",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/another-world-lies-beyond-chinese-art-and-the-divine,"Premodern China teemed with images of the divine. From the humblest printed image of the Stove God, hung in the kitchen, to the most lavish ritual painting created for a Buddhist monastery, people filled their world with objects that served as portals to realms beyond their own and to forces beyond their control. This exhibition presents a rich display of such images—mostly drawn from the Museum's collection—ranging from serene, monochrome Buddhist paintings to raucous, colorful sculptures of popular deities. The exhibition begins with galleries devoted to Buddhist art. Arising in India and brought to China by traveling teachers around two thousand years ago, Buddhism became a major force in Chinese spiritual life and a wellspring of popular and liturgical imagery. One gallery is devoted to the arts of Daoism, a native religion that draws on both ancient Chinese philosophy and popular religious practice. The final galleries are devoted to the divine presence in the home and in the countryside, as expressed in popular deities and fantastical creatures. An important characteristic of spiritual life in premodern China was its fluidity. This can be seen throughout the exhibition in the easy mixing of ideas and iconographies, with Daoist figures appearing in Buddhist paintings, for instance. In the same spirit, the presence of artworks from Persia, Tibet, Japan, and Korea demonstrates how readily deities, teachings, and artistic styles crossed political and cultural boundaries in the premodern world. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

But in 1974, Senegalese scholar and humanist Cheikh Anta Diop shocked and challenged historians by asserting the influence of ancient African civilizations in his groundbreaking bookThe African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality. This exhibition pays homage to Diop by presenting masterpieces from the Museum’s collections from west and central Africa alongside art from ancient Egypt for the first time in The Met’s history. Through twenty-one pairings of works from different African cultures and eras, this exhibition provides a rare opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary creativity of the continent across five millennia, revealing unexpected parallels and contrasts. Although there was no contact between their creators, the works share deep and underrecognized histories. The African Origin of Civilizationwill remain on view while The Met’s galleries of Sub-Saharan African Art are closed for thecomplete renovationof the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing. The re-envisioned wing is expected to reopen in 2024, and will feature three distinct suites of galleries for Sub-Saharan African Art, Ancient American Art, and Oceanic Art.

2021,The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Met,"May 24, 2021–January 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/good-life-collecting-late-antique-art,"The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Metshowcases the Museum’s important and rare collection of third- to eighth-century art from Egypt and reevaluates it through the lens of late antique ideas about abundance, virtue, and shared classical taste. Writers and craftspeople translated these ideas into a concept celebrated as the “the good life.” Anchored by crucial gifts to The Met of late antique art, the exhibition explores themes connected to social status, wealth, and living well in Late Antiquity. The core of The Met’s collection from late antique Egypt was formed through public subscriptions and generous gifts in the 1890s. The first decades after the Museum’s founding was a time when profound interest in the earliest Christian art inspired scholars, collectors, and the public alike. Today, The Met continues to collect late antique art that reveals the burgeoning of literary and visual representations of a life well lived. This exhibition highlights The Met’s holdings of late antique textiles, decorative arts, jewelry, and sculpture—all highly prized by elite patrons of the Byzantine Empire’s southern provinces in Africa. The works of art featured in the exhibition reflect the extraordinary wealth of Mediterranean Africa. In addition to marking status, these objects responded to such fundamental questions as, What does it mean to “live well”? During the period, ideas about “the good life” intersected with issues of religion, identity, and relationships with the past. As a result, these objects not only testify to The Met’s long-standing interest in late antique art of the region but also shed light on some of the aspirations, values, and lifestyles of its upper classes. #MetByzantine The exhibition is made possible by The Giorgi Family Foundation."
2021,In Praise of Painting: Dutch Masterpieces at The Met,"October 16, 2018–September 17, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/in-praise-of-painting-dutch-masterpieces,"Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century—the Golden Age of Rembrandt, Hals, and Vermeer—have been a highlight of The Met collection since the Museum's founding purchase in 1871. This exhibition brings together some of the Museum's greatest paintings to present this remarkable chapter of art history in a new light. Through sixty-seven works of art organized thematically,In Praise of Paintingorients visitors to key issues in seventeenth-century Dutch culture—from debates about religion and conspicuous consumption to painters' fascination with the domestic lives of women. The exhibition provides a fresh perspective on the canon and parameters of the Dutch Golden Age by uniting paintings from Benjamin Altman's bequest, the Robert Lehman Collection, and the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection. Works typically displayed separately in the Museum's galleries—such as Rembrandt'sGerard de Lairesseand Lairesse's ownApollo and Aurora—are presented side by side, producing a visually compelling narrative about the tensions between realism and idealism during this period. The presentation also provides the opportunity to conserve and display rarely exhibited paintings, including Margareta Haverman'sA Vase of Flowers—one of only two known paintings by the artist and the only painting by an early modern Dutch woman currently in The Met collection. The exhibition takes its title from one of the period's major works of art theory, Philips Angel'sThe Praise of Painting(1642), a pioneering defense of realism in art.

2021,A New Look at Old Masters,"December 12, 2020–March 26, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/a-new-look-at-old-masters,"A New Look at Old Masterswill explore a variety of themes in The Met’s collection of European painting, creating new dialogues among the works and including a large presentation of sculpture. While one gallery will highlight the creation of still life and genre painting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, two others will provide an overview of oil sketches from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, leading up to the Museum's unsurpassed collection of works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. A large gallery will display portraiture in the Grand Siècle, juxtaposing outstanding paintings by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck with Charles Le Brun’s monumental family portrait of the banker Everhard Jabach. The eighteenth-century French galleries will take up such themes as the study of expression, François Boucher and the decorative arts, and the role of female artists, who finally found a place in the academy. The Met’s unique collection of French Neoclassical painting, dominated by gifts fromJayne Wrightsman, will be installed with sculptured busts by Jean Antoine Houdon of the essential figures of the Enlightenment: Denis Diderot and Voltaire. These are just a few examples of the novel themes that will be on display. A New Look at Old Mastersis part of theEuropean Paintings Skylights Projectand is a prelude to the final, expansive re-installation of the European Paintings galleries that will take place after the project is completed."
2021,"Bodhisattvas of Wisdom, Compassion, and Power","March 27, 2021–October 30, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/bodhisattvas-wisdom-compassion-power,"Within the Buddhist traditions of the Himalayas, three bodhisattvas emerge as personifications of Buddhist ideals. Manjushri, who cuts through ignorance and personifies correct knowledge; Avalokiteshvara, a compassionate protector of the devout that helps reveal the true nature of reality; and Vajrapani as the embodiment of the energy of enlightenment. Focusing on dramatic images, a worshipper could first evoke the subtle knowledge that Manjushri personifies, then with Avalokiteshvara’s aid, it is possible to proceed in a way free from self-imposed delusions, while Vajrapani’s transcendent power aids in destroying jealousy and hatred that stand in the way of enlightenment. Venerating these three bodhisattvas together has a long history, and they play an essential role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet. This exhibition draws together a dramatic group of paintings, sculptures, ritual objects, and illustrated manuscripts from the eleventh to eighteenth centuries, made primarily for Nepal and Tibet’s monastic institutions. Beautifully cast sculptures and accessible paintings showing peaceful manifestations of the bodhisattvas intended for the public are juxtaposed with complex tantric images of the highest quality done in portable media made for monastic elites. Vajrayana images offered powerful ways to access these bodhisattvas as a personal path to enlightenment, though often undertaking such rituals was done with a ruler’s sponsorship for the people’s benefit. This exhibition presents some of the sublime representations of these three bodhisattvas at the center of this great devotional tradition embraced across the Himalayas. The exhibition is made possible by The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Foundation Fund."
2021,Gifts from the Fire: American Ceramics from the Collection of Martin Eidelberg,"October 22, 2021–October 30, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/gifts-from-the-fire,"Following the nation’s Centennial in 1876, American ceramics, often inspired by Europe, China, and Japan, quickly developed into an art form that demonstrated the nation’s own artistic originality. This exhibition of over 150 works dating from the early 1880s to the early 1950s, features a selection from the recent gift to The Met by scholar Martin Eidelberg. This collection includes works of extraordinary diversity—with stylized decoration, often jewel-like glazes, and even displays of whimsy. Together, they illuminate the impressive accomplishments of American potteries and ceramists from cities across the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Emphasized throughout the exhibition are the creations of women artists, who had newly moved into professional pottery during this time, including works with exquisite carved decoration by such pioneering artists as Adelaide Alsop Robineau, who worked in porcelain and developed lustrous crystalline glazes. Other artists include Louis C. Tiffany and his nature-inspired vessels; the eccentric potter George E. Ohr, from Biloxi, Mississippi; and Artus Van Briggle and his wife Anna Van Briggle, with their Art Nouveau and Symbolist-inspired work in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Between the wars, talented émigré ceramists adapted prevailing styles from their countries and produced work often in a modernist vein. A multiplicity of voices characterizes this era of American ceramics with new styles, new materials, and new techniques all on display. The exhibition is made possible by the Frank H. & Eva B. Buck Foundation. The catalogue is made possible by the William Cullen Bryant Fellows of The Metropolitan Museum of Art."

It establishes a modern vocabulary of American fashion based on its expressive qualities. This portion of the exhibition uses the organizing principle of a patchwork quilt. A signature quilt begun in 1856 from The Met's American Wing collection opens the show, and serves as a metaphor for the United States and its varied cultural identities. Approximately 100 men’s and women’s ensembles by a diverse range of designers from the 1940s to the present are featured. Enclosed in scrimmed cases that represent three-dimensional “patches” of a quilt, they are organized into 12 sections that explore defining emotional qualities: Nostalgia, Belonging, Delight, Joy, Wonder, Affinity, Confidence, Strength, Desire, Assurance, Comfort, and Consciousness. Part two,In America: An Anthology of Fashion—opening in the American Wing period rooms on May 7, 2022—will present sartorial narratives that relate to the complex and layered histories of those rooms. #MetInAmerica@MetCostumeInstitute  Capacity is limited and access is first come, first served.

2021,Companions in Solitude: Reclusion and Communion in Chinese Art,"July 31, 2021–August 14, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/companions-in-solitude,"This exhibition will explore the twin themes of solitude and togetherness in Chinese art. For more than two thousand years, reclusion—removing oneself from society—has been presented as the ideal condition for mental cultivation and transcending worldly troubles. At the same time, communion with like-minded people has been celebrated as essential to the human experience. This choice, to be alone or to be together, has been central to the lives of thinkers and artists, and Chinese art abounds with images of figures who pursued both paths—as well as those who wove them together in complex and surprising ways.Companions in Solitude, presented in two rotations, will bring together more than 120 works of painting, calligraphy, and decorative arts that illuminate this choice—depictions of why and how people have sought space from the world or attempted to bridge the divide between themselves and others. In the wake of 2020, a year that has isolated us physically but connected us virtually in unprecedented ways, this exploration of premodern Chinese reclusion and communion will invite meditation on the fracture and facture of human connection in our own time.

2021,Shell and Resin: Korean Mother-of-Pearl and Lacquer,"December 13, 2021–July 5, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/shell-and-resin,"Lacquerware with mother-of-pearl inlay has a long and rich tradition in the history of Korean art. This exhibition showcases nearly thirty outstanding works of Korean lacquerware from The Met collection and marks the Museum’s first exhibition dedicated solely to Korean lacquerware. The pieces are arranged thematically by motif to illustrate the technical and aesthetic development of the art form and acknowledge the greater Asian context through comparative examples of Chinese, Japanese, and Ryūkyū (Okinawan) lacquers and South Asian mother-of-pearl. The exhibition begins with a twelfth-century trefoil box, noteworthy for its rarity, exceptional technique, and intricate inlay, and follows the tradition to the present with contemporary works by master artists. Lacquer—an English word derived from the Portuguese word lacré (sealing wax)—refers to the toxic sap sourced from trees belonging to the Toxicodendron genus widely found in Korea, Japan, southern China, and Southeast Asia. When exposed to oxygen and humidity, lacquer hardens, or polymerizes, becoming a natural plastic and ideal protective covering. The term “mother-of-pearl” has been used since at least the sixteenth century to describe the lustrous material in the interior of some mollusks in many parts of the world. The exhibition explores the manner in which lacquer and mother-of-pearl are often paired yet have distinct materiality. The exhibition is made possible by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, The Republic of Korea (MCST)."

Beginning in the early 1970s, the Irvings built one of the most comprehensive and superb collections of Chinese art in the world. For more than three decades, the couple helped The Met acquire important artworks and provided support for exhibitions, and their passion was a factor in building the current exhibition galleries dedicated to Chinese decorative arts. Their generous gifts of more than five hundred exceptional objects fundamentally transformed the holdings of Chinese art at The Met.The approximately 120 works on display (in each rotation) cover almost all major categories of Chinese art, with a focus on three-dimensional objects, including lacquer, ceramic, metal work, jade, bamboo, and stone carvings. Created by both famous and unknown masters, these extraordinary works represent the artistic sophistication and technical virtuosity of Chinese decorative arts from the tenth through the early twentieth century. In addition to the Irvings’ well-known assemblage of lacquer ware, the exhibition also showcases their recent gifts of a group of jade and bamboo works from the eighteenth-century imperial workshop that have never before been on display. This presentation reunites important private loans formerly in the Irvings’ collection with comparative pieces from The Met collection.Rotation 1: January 30—October 17, 2021Rotation 2: October 23, 2021—June 5, 2022 The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

The show explores the flourishing of photography as a medium between World War II and the Vietnam War and includes several mini-monographic presentations on a group of diverse photographers including Helen Levitt, Roy DeCarava, Mario De Biasi, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Don McCullin, and Aaron Rose. The exhibition features classic photographs seldom seen, acquisitions that the Museum has not yet exhibited, and magazines and books by Japanese photographers—also notable gifts to The Met and works of art in their own right. The show’s title is borrowed fromLet Us Now Praise Famous Men, James Agee and Walker Evans’s collaborative depression-era masterpiece published in 1941. Agee writes about what he believed was Evans’s (and photography’s) greatest achievement and challenge: “all of consciousness is shifted from the imagined … to the effort to perceive simply the cruel radiance of what is.” The exhibition is made possible by The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, Inc."
2021,Alter Egos | Projected Selves,"November 22, 2021–May 1, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/alter-egos-projected-selves,"Aliases, avatars, and alter egos abound in today’s media, from pseudonyms and selfies on social platforms to packaged personae in pop culture. What’s more, in a society shaped by a global pandemic, we all have become accustomed to projecting virtual versions of ourselves, experiencing the perks and pitfalls of routinely enacting “self-portraits.” Artists, of course, have long employed themselves as the subjects of their work, a convention that is especially rich within the history of photography. The camera, when turned on oneself, seems singularly equipped to expose multiple interior lives, whether real or imagined. The photograph, as the product of this interaction, facilitates the realization of different selves and diverse ways of being in the world. Drawn primarily from The Met collection, the works in this exhibition demonstrate how, especially in recent decades, many artists have deployed themselves as photographic subjects in order to experiment with identity, invent or disrupt narratives, and intervene in the medium of photography itself. Before and behind the camera, they toy with the expectations of self-portraiture. Posing in costume, photographers from Nadar to Nikki S. Lee appropriate imagined identities. Tom Friedman and Ellen Carey manipulate their images beyond recognition, and Qualeasha Wood, in a bold affirmation of digital imagery, weaves her online avatars into a glitchy composite.

2021,Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts,"December 10, 2021–March 6, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/inspiring-walt-disney,"Pink castles, talking sofas, and objects coming to life: what sounds like fantasies from the pioneering animation of Walt Disney Animation Studios were in fact the figments of the colorful salons of Rococo Paris. The Met’s first-ever exhibition exploring the work of Walt Disney and the hand-drawn animation of Walt Disney Animation Studios will examine Disney’s personal fascination with European art and the use of French motifs in his films and theme parks, drawing new parallels between the studios’ magical creations and their artistic models. Sixty works of 18th-century European decorative arts and design—from tapestries and furniture to Boulle clocks and Sèvres porcelain—will be featured alongside 150 production artworks and works on paper from the Walt Disney Animation Research Library, Walt Disney Archives, Walt Disney Imagineering Collection, and The Walt Disney Family Museum. Selected film footage illustrating the extraordinary technological and artistic developments of the studio during Disney’s lifetime and beyond will also be shown. The exhibition will highlight references to European visual culture in Disney animated films, including nods to Gothic Revival architecture inCinderella(1950), medieval influences onSleeping Beauty(1959), and Rococo-inspired objects brought to life inBeauty and the Beast(1991).

2021,"Spain, 1000–1200: Art at the Frontiers of Faith","August 30, 2021–February 13, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/spain-show-cloisters," Español Communities of Christians, Muslims, and Jews lived side by side in Spain for centuries, creating vibrant artistic traditions that often intersected. For the first time since its inauguration at The Met Cloisters in 1961, the Fuentidueña Chapel gallery, which typically focuses on the Christian tradition, will present a group of works that testify to the diversity of Spanish medieval art. By telling a more nuanced story in this space, the exhibition will demonstrate the ease with which objects and artistic ideas transcended differences of belief. Placed in dialogue with each other, the silk textiles, ivory carvings, illuminated manuscripts, frescoes, and monumental sculptures featured in the show will reveal a dynamic, interconnected past that often mirrors the present.The exhibition’s chronology, 1000 to 1200, corresponds to a pivotal era in the history of the Spanish Middle Ages—one that saw significant shifts in the balance of power between Christian and Muslim rulers, destabilizing long-standing social relationships and introducing new tensions among religious communities. Yet the visual arts make it clear that this was not a purely divisive age. In exploring how artists and patrons of the day drew from many sources of inspiration, negotiating the visual traditions of different religions,Spain, 1000–1200: Art at the Frontiers of Faithwill showcase the richness and complexity of interfaith interaction. In so doing, the exhibition draws upon the concept of the frontier—a boundary that simultaneously separates and connects—as a metaphor for Spain as a place of artistic creation.This exhibition will be accompanied by the Fall 2021 MetBulletin.#MetMedieval The exhibition andBulletinare made possible by the Michel David-Weill Fund.Additional support for theBulletinis provided by Tom and Diahn McGrath.The Met’s quarterlyBulletinprogram is supported in part by the Lila Acheson Wallace Fund for The Metropolitan Museum of Art, established by the cofounder ofReader’s Digest."
2021,Spring Blossoms: Margaret Armstrong’s Decorated Publishers’ Bindings,"February 15, 2020–January 31, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/spring-blossoms,"Margaret Armstrong (1867–1944) was an author, book cover designer, field collector, and botanical illustrator. She was among the most influential designers of her time and a source of inspiration for other female book cover designers and future generations including Amy M. Sacker, Lee Thayer, and Marion Louise Peabody. Armstrong’s first book cover design,Sweet Williamby Marguerite Bouvet, was published in 1890. Early in her career she met reluctance placing her designs with publishers, as the field of book cover design was dominated by men. To surmount this challenge, she signed her early submissions “M.N. Armstrong.” However, the years 1892–93 were groundbreaking for women book cover designers: several important exhibitions in prominent clubs and at the World’s Columbian Exposition featured women designers and paved the way for the success they enjoyed during the next decades. As Armstrong’s career as a book designer progressed, her designs became more fluid and individualized, reflecting the book’s subject. With her increasingly colorful, striking book covers, she was in demand as a designer and worked for twenty-one different publishers producing approximately 270 book cover designs. Spring Blossoms: Margaret Armstrong’s Decorated Publishers’ Bindings, Watson Library’s first online exhibition, presents a selection of books with covers designed by Armstrong from the 1890s to 1913. The exhibit highlights four themes: designs that invoke the patterns of stained glass, the lavender series of publications by Myrtle Reed, designs featuring flowers and plant forms, and lesser-known book covers.

2021,Surrealism Beyond Borders,"October 11, 2021–January 30, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/surrealism-beyond-borders," A telephone receiver that morphs into a lobster. A miniature train that rushes from a fireplace. These are just a few of the familiar images associated with Surrealism, a revolutionary idea sparked in Paris around 1924 that asserted the unconscious and dreams over the familiar and every day. While Surrealism could generate often poetic and even humorous works, it was also taken up as a far more serious weapon in the struggle for political, social, and personal freedom, and by many more artists around the world. Nearly from its inception, Surrealism has had an international scope, but knowledge of the movement has been formed primarily through a Western European focus. This exhibition reconsiders the true “movement” of Surrealism across boundaries of geography and chronology—and within networks that span Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, Asia to North Africa, and Australia to Latin America. Including almost eight decades of work produced across 45 countries,Surrealism Beyond Bordersoffers a fresh appraisal of these collective concerns and exchanges—as well as historical, national, and local distinctions—that will recast appreciation of this most revolutionary and globe-spanning movement. #SurrealismBeyond To access the booklet of all in-gallery labels, clickhere.

2021,Relative Values: The Cost of Art in the Northern Renaissance,"August 7, 2017–January 23, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/relative-values-northern-renaissance,"Bringing together sixty-two masterpieces of sixteenth-century northern European art from The Met collection and one important loan, this exhibition revolves around questions of historical worth, exploring relative value systems in the Renaissance era. Organized in six sections—raw materials, virtuosity, technological advances, fame, market, and paragone—tapestry, stained and vessel glass, sculpture, paintings, precious metal-work, and enamels are juxtaposed with pricing data from sixteenth-century documents. What did a tapestry cost in the sixteenth century? Goldsmiths' work? Stained glass? How did variables like raw materials, work hours, levels of expertise and artistry, geography, and rarity, affect this? Did production cost necessarily align with perceived market valuation in inventoried collections? Who assigned these values? By exploring different sixteenth-century yardsticks of gauging worth, by probing extrinsic versus intrinsic value, and by presenting works of different media and function side-by-side, the exhibition captures a sense of the splendor and excitement of this era.

2021,Celebrating the Year of the Ox,"January 30, 2021–January 17, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/year-of-the-ox,"The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating 12–year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century B.C. and became firmly established by the first century A.D. The 12 animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of the people born in that year. This Lunar New Year, which begins on February 12, 2021, is the Year of the Ox. In celebration of the Year of the Ox, this exhibition presents depictions of oxen and water buffalo (considered the same category of animals in China) created by artists in the last 3,000 years. Particularly notable are a massive eighteenth-century jade sculpture of a water buffalo and a remarkable eighth-century set of ceramic Chinese zodiac figures, illustrating the important role that the animals play in the life of humans.

Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject.For centuries, art has played a role in revolutions, protests, and social activist movements. This installation explores how artists from the eighteenth century to the present have mobilized works on paper to promote causes or ideals, record or respond to events, and sway public opinion. The drawings, prints, and posters on view relate to the American, French, Haitian, Mexican, and Russian revolutions, the abolition of slavery, and campaigns for and against the dominant political systems of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As this grouping demonstrates, artists have turned to printmaking, in particular, to call attention to racial, gender, and economic injustices.  A selection of prints investigate the role art has played in revolutions, protests, and social activist movements from the eighteenth century to the present. Read more on Perspectives."

Their subjects—which included factories and underground trains, war-torn landscapes and “dazzle ships,” leisure activities, and the countryside as both idealized rural landscape and one transformed by urban expansion—reveal an interest in speed, motion, labor, industrialization, technology, and modernity broadly considered. In addition to traditional printmaking methods, artists embraced new techniques, such as the color linocut, which represented the artists’ democratic aspirations for both art making and collecting.The exhibition will celebrate the transformative acquisition of British modernist works on paper from the collection of Leslie and Johanna Garfield, the most significant collection of its kind. Featured artists include Sybil Andrews, Claude Flight, Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson, Cyril Power, and Edward Wadsworth, as well as international artists who worked or studied in Britain, such as Edward McKnight Kauffer and Lill Tschudi.

2021,Jules Tavernier and the Elem Pomo,"August 16–November 28, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/jules-tavernier,"Jules Tavernier and the Elem Pomoexplores the intercultural exchange between French-born and -trained American artist Jules Tavernier (1844–1889) and the Indigenous Pomo community of Elem at Clear Lake in Northern California. Investigating Tavernier’s life and career, the exhibition is centered around his rediscovered masterworkDance in a Subterranean Roundhouse at Clear Lake, California(1878), which depicts a ceremonial dance of the Elem Pomo known asmfom Xe, or “people dance,” in an underground roundhouse. Commissioned by San Francisco’s leading banker, Tiburcio Parrott, as a gift for his Parisian business partner, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, the work celebrates the rich vitality of Elem Pomo culture, while also exposing the threat posed by White settlers, including Parrott, who was then operating a toxic mercury mine on the community’s ancestral homelands. Designated a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1990, the mine continues to negatively impact the lives of the sovereign people of the present-day Elem Indian Colony. The exhibition brings together approximately 60 works by a range of artists—paintings, prints, watercolors, and photographs—to tell the story of Tavernier’s travels through Nebraska, Wyoming, California, and the Hawaiian Islands, incorporating a multiplicity of voices and perspectives, including those of Pomo cultural leaders and curators, who offer new interpretations. Major paintings by Tavernier will be shown alongside examples of 19th- to 21st-century Pomo basketry and regalia, including works by weaver Clint McKay (Dry Creek Pomo/Wappo/Wintun, born 1965), to celebrate the resiliency of Indigenous Pomo peoples and highlight their continued cultural presence today.

2021,"The Facade Commission: Carol Bove,The séances aren’t helping","March 1–October 26, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/facade-commission-carol-bove,"Created by the artist Carol Bove (born 1971),The séances aren’t helpingis the second commission to be featured on the facade of The Met Fifth Avenue. Working improvisationally, Bove sculpts at scale and in the round, without any preparatory drawings. For this commission, she used a one-to-one mock-up of the Museum’s empty niches to construct four abstract sculptures made of sandblasted, contorted stainless-steel tubes and five-foot-wide reflective aluminum disks. Despite the weight and heft of these sculptures, they appear astoundingly lithe and supple, almost mercurial—an effect Bove achieves by pushing her materials to their physical limits. Projecting outward from the niches, the works confound perception. For her sculptures, Bove chose a series of nonrepresentational forms that resonate with modernist styles such as Art Deco and abstraction—a stark contrast to the traditional figurative sculptures that the architect Richard Morris Hunt intended to feature (yet never realized) on the facade, which was completed in 1902. Bove based the size of the aluminum disks on the diameter of the columns that flank the Museum’s niches and the medallion portraits that adorn the spandrels of the arches. The differing orientations result in a playful rhythmic pattern, yielding a frisson of delight that might throw us slightly off balance. By astutely engaging the Museum’s 119-year-old facade, reimagining its history, and retooling some of its architectural and design elements, the artist subtly calls for us to reevaluate and reckon with the legacies of tradition. As the title—The séances aren’t helping—suggests and Bove’s works demonstrate, grappling with the past can be a challenging yet powerful exercise. #MetFacade #MetCarolBove The exhibition is made possible by the Director’s Fund, the Diane W. and James E. Burke Fund, Helene and Johannes Huth, and Cynthia Hazen Polsky and Leon B. Polsky. Additional support is provided by the John & Amy Griffin Foundation, Inc. and the Speyer Family Foundation.

This juried exhibition of work by talented young artists showcases the creativity of 152 prekindergarten through grade 12 students from all five boroughs, including students from District 75, a citywide district serving students with disabilities. The exhibition consists of paintings, prints, sculptures, photographs, mixed-media works, collages, and drawings. Each work of art demonstrates personal expression, imaginative use of media, the results of close observation, and an understanding of artistic processes. Dedicated art teachers support students’ creativity and help them look closely in order to respond to their worlds through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and learn to harness their imaginations for artistic expression. This exhibition celebrates the students’ journeys and discoveries from early childhood to young adulthood. Moreover, the work on view and accompanying student statements are a testament to the creativity and resilience of teachers and students working in remote, onsite, and hybrid environments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A panel of arts specialists from the Department of Education and Studio in a School selected 289 semifinalists from almost eight hundred submissions. A jury of distinguished members of the New York City arts community, including staff of The Met, met virtually to choose the works on display in P.S. Art 2021 .

The key figure in this transformation was Cosimo I de’ Medici, who became Duke of Florence in 1537, following the assassination of his predecessor, Alessandro de’ Medici. Cosimo shrewdly employed culture as a political tool in order to convert the mercantile city into the capital of a dynastic Medicean state, enlisting the leading intellectuals and artists of his time and promoting grand architectural, engineering, and artistic projects. Through Giorgio Vasari's famous written work Lives of the Artists , which was dedicated to the duke, Florence was promoted as the cradle of the Renaissance. Through an outstanding group of portraits, this major loan exhibition will introduce visitors to the various new and complex ways that artists portrayed the elite of Medicean Florence, representing the sitters’ political and cultural ambitions and conveying the changing sense of what it meant to be a Florentine at this defining moment in the city’s history. The exhibition will feature over 90 works in a wide range of mediums, from paintings, sculptural busts, medals, and carved gemstones to drawings, etchings, manuscripts, and armor. Included are works by the period’s most celebrated artists, from Raphael, Jacopo Pontormo, and Rosso Fiorentino to Benvenuto Cellini, Agnolo Bronzino, and Francesco Salviati.

2021,The New Woman Behind the Camera,"July 2–October 3, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/new-woman-behind-the-camera,"The New Woman of the 1920s was a powerful expression of modernity, a global phenomenon that embodied an ideal of female empowerment based on real women making revolutionary changes in life and art. Featuring more than 120 photographers from over 20 countries, this groundbreaking exhibition explores the work of the diverse “new” women who embraced photography as a mode of professional and artistic expression from the 1920s through the 1950s. During this tumultuous period shaped by two world wars, women stood at the forefront of experimentation with the camera and produced invaluable visual testimony that reflects both their personal experiences and the extraordinary social and political transformations of the era. The exhibition is the first to take an international approach to the subject, highlighting female photographers’ innovative work in studio portraiture, fashion and advertising, artistic experimentation, street photography, ethnography, and photojournalism. Among the photographers featured are Berenice Abbott, Ilse Bing, Lola Álvarez Bravo, Florestine Perrault Collins, Imogen Cunningham, Madame d’Ora, Florence Henri, Elizaveta Ignatovich, Consuelo Kanaga, Germaine Krull, Dorothea Lange, Dora Maar, Tina Modotti, Niu Weiyu, Tsuneko Sasamoto, Gerda Taro, and Homai Vyarawalla. Inspired by the global phenomenon of the New Woman, the exhibition seeks to reevaluate the history of photography and advance new and more inclusive conversations on the contributions of female photographers. Virtual Group Tours available by request. The exhibition is made possible in part by the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, The Daniel and Estrellita Brodsky Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. It is organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, in association with The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

2021,Shapes from Out of Nowhere: Ceramics from the Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection,"February 22–August 29, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/shapes-from-out-of-nowhere,"Shapes from Out of Nowhere: Ceramics from the Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection celebrates an extraordinary gift of 125 modern and contemporary ceramics from Robert A. Ellison Jr., made to The Met in honor of the Museum’s 150th anniversary. The exhibition will present a selection of over 75 works from this unparalleled collection that charts the evolution of abstraction in clay from the second half of the twentieth century through the present. The exhibition highlights the myriad approaches embraced by artists who have challenged the long history of clay and its reliance on the potter’s wheel—from slight deviations of traditional vessel forms to deconstructions that reject utility and exploit the boundless experimentation that clay affords. Mid-twentieth-century by artists Axel Salto, Ken Price, Toshiko Takaezu, Katherine Choy, Peter Voulkos, and Win Ng, are seen alongside contemporary creations by Aneta Regel, Kathy Butterly, Syd Carpenter, and Lynda Benglis—artists who continue to expand the possibilities of the medium. Included in the exhibition are eight striking works by the late nineteenth-century artist George Ohr. These loans from Ellison’s private collection attest to Ohr’s radical vision and foreshadow the embrace of abstraction and nonrepresentational forms by artists in the 1950s and 60s. Ellison’s extraordinary gift and this exhibition represent over forty years of collecting ceramics, a passion that eventually crystallized into the singular approach of nonrepresentational form in clay. Shapes from Out of Nowhere: Ceramics from the Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection presents the work of forty-nine artists whose works reject any lingering ideas of medium-based hierarchies and celebrates artistic expression. With heavy hearts we acknowledge the passing of Robert A. Ellison Jr. on July 9, 2021. The exhibition is made possible by The Modern Circle."
2021,Alice Neel: People Come First,"March 22–August 1, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/alice-neel,"Alice Neel: People Come First is the first museum retrospective in New York of American artist Alice Neel (1900–1984) in twenty years. This ambitious survey positions Neel as one of the century’s most radical painters, a champion of social justice whose longstanding commitment to humanist principles inspired her life as well as her art, as demonstrated in the approximately one hundred paintings, drawings, and watercolors that will appear in The Met’s survey. Images of activists demonstrating against fascism and racism appear alongside paintings of impoverished victims of the Great Depression, as well as portraits of Neel’s neighbors in Spanish Harlem, leaders from a wide range of political organizations, queer artists and performers, and members of New York’s global diaspora. The exhibition also highlights Neel’s erotic watercolors and pastels from the 1930s, her depictions of mothers, and her paintings of nude figures (some of them visibly pregnant), all of whose candor and irreverence are without precedent in the history of Western art. Neel was a longtime resident of New York, and the city served as her most faithful subject. Indeed, the sum total of her work testifies to the drama of its streets, the quotidian beauty of its buildings, and, most importantly, the diversity, resilience, and passion of its residents. “For me, people come first,” Neel declared in 1950. “I have tried to assert the dignity and eternal importance of the human being.” Accompanied by a catalogue . #MetAliceNeel “A perfect show for right now” — Washington Post “It’s inspiring to see how alert and endlessly curious she was about meeting new people, getting to know them, and capturing their essence” — Observer “ Neel pays scrupulous attention to details other artists might gloss over. ” — Wall Street Journal “Alice Neel is a great artist, and among the greatest portraiturists that’s ever lived."" — WNYC “Experiencing Neel’s work at the Met— after a full year of loss and social upheaval— her gigantic vision, perseverance, and the tragedies of her life tell us that we could be heroes like her and the people she painted.""— Vulture The exhibition is made possible by the Barrie A. and Deedee Wigmore Foundation. Major support is provided by the Adrienne Arsht Fund for Resilience through Art. Additional funding is provided by Angela A. Chao and Jim Breyer, Agnes Gund, and the Jane and Robert Carroll Fund.

Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. During the celebration of the Museum's 150th anniversary, the Department of Drawings and Prints presents four thematic installations that take an in-depth look at the fabric of its collections. This fourth installation is designed to elucidate the broad range of materials and techniques used by artists in Europe and the United States to create works on paper from the Renaissance to the present day. Different sections of the gallery offer explanations and varied examples of works featuring materials such as graphite, ink and wash, chalk, watercolor, and pastel, and techniques such as woodcut, engraving, lithography, and screenprint. With examples chosen from across cultures and time periods, the selection highlights technical facility and innovation.

2021,Karl Bodmer: North American Portraits,"April 5–July 25, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/karl-bodmer-north-american-portraits,"Swiss-born Karl Bodmer (1809–1893) was one of the first and most accomplished European artists to document the landscape of the North American interior and its Indigenous peoples. He was hired by the German explorer and naturalist Maximilian, Prince of Wied-Neuwied, to accompany an expedition to the northwestern reaches of the Missouri River in 1833–34. Together they traveled from Saint Louis through the tribal lands of the Omaha, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Blackfoot, among many Plains nations where Bodmer executed watercolor portraits in situ. A meticulous draftsman, he produced portraits that are notable for their sensitivity of depiction and subtle, refined brushwork. Bodmer’s precise observation of his sitters—in facial likeness, body decoration, and regalia—conveys eyewitness testimony to the lives of specific individuals and the complexity of cultural encounters. The exhibition features thirty-five portraits, along with six landscape and genre scenes, and several related aquatints, all from the comprehensive Bodmer holdings of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha. #BodmerPortraits ""Pathbreaking exhibition""— The Magazine Antiques The exhibition is made possible by the Warner Foundation Fund and the Louis and Virginia Clemente Foundation Fund.

2021,Georg Baselitz: Pivotal Turn,"January 28–July 18, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/georg-baselitz-pivotal-turn,"Georg Baselitz: Pivotal Turn displays six landmark paintings gifted by the artist to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in honor of its 150th anniversary. Made in 1969, they are among the first works in which Georg Baselitz (b. 1938) employed the strategy of inversion, an approach that continues to be of interest to him. The paintings mark a critical moment in the artist’s career as he sought to expunge narrative content and expression—elements present in his earlier work—in order to focus on painting itself. To achieve this, Baselitz began representing his subjects upside down and embraced traditional genres that he had previously avoided, including nudes, landscapes, and portraits. The compositional and conceptual conceit of upending the figures fundamentally destabilizes the viewer’s perspective and, by extension, thwarts our ability to firmly identify narrative, content type, and artistic tradition. This group of portraits, which includes the first-ever painting of his wife, Elke, provides a rare opportunity to study a pivotal moment of artistic innovation."

2021,Arte del mar: Artistic Exchange in the Caribbean,"December 16, 2019–June 27, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/arte-del-mar-caribbean,"Español Arte del mar (""art of/from the sea"") explores the artistic exchange around the rim of the Caribbean Sea before the sixteenth century between the Taíno civilizations of the Antilles archipelago and their powerful peers on the continental mainland. Recent archaeological, ethnohistorical, and art-historical research has deepened our understanding of indigenous Caribbean concepts of ritual knowledge, ceremonial performance, and political power. Artists in the region—which includes the modern Antilles archipelago and countries such as Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Honduras—sought to express the distinct force of their deities and ancestors, known to the Taínos as zemí (or cemí ), which pervaded the environment and was crucial to the foundation of communities. Pendants and other objects worn and used by leaders in ceremonies were created from imported luxury materials and share a formal grammar that is inextricably linked with deeply rooted mythological narratives. Works of art on view in the exhibition, largely drawn from The Met collection, celebrate the region's ancestral traditions, and a twentieth-century painting by an Afro-Caribbean artist explores their enduring legacy. ""A concentrated showcase at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that plunges visitors into a sea of archipelagic thinking.

2021,Chinese Painting and Calligraphy Up Close,"December 21, 2020–June 27, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/chinese-painting-calligraphy,"Close looking is at the heart of Chinese painting and calligraphy. In premodern China, painters and calligraphers learned by copying, a practice that required heightened observation of details. In the process, they also learned how to look—how to detect fine distinctions of ink tone, saturation, and line. Only after years of this type of intense looking could a person be considered a true expert. This exhibition will encourage such looking by displaying original artworks alongside photographic enlargements of their details. The magnified details draw attention to subtleties of brushwork, texture, and line that may escape a viewer at first glance. Ultimately, the enlargements draw us back to the original, revealing the rewards that close looking can offer. On view in two rotations will be some of the most celebrated works of Chinese painting and calligraphy from the Museum's collection. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."

Almost a quarter of New York City's population visited ""Neighborhood Circulating Exhibitions,"" which were developed in response to an inquiry from a Queens high school teacher. This remarkable initiative brought selections from the Museum's collection to as many New Yorkers as possible, through a series of small, traveling exhibitions displayed in high schools, public libraries, and other public institutions across the five boroughs. This installation will showcase the important role of European textiles in this educational effort, with a selection of textiles displayed alongside documents from The Met's archives. These highlights will be reunited with an extraordinary series of 1930s photographs capturing the original events, their locations, and their visitors. Exhibits will range from Italian Renaissance velvet to French eighteenth-century printed cotton, and will include the first showing in decades of The Met's exquisite cope made for Antonio Barberini, nephew of the infamous Pope Urban VIII.

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate in large batches his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards—along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters—to The Met. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. This exhibition features over one hundred cards produced between the 1890s and the 1950s. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era, at the turn of the nineteenth century, through the golden age and modern era of the sport. Produced using various types of media—from photography to lithography—the cards feature legends of the game as well as lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

2021,"Pictures, Revisited","October 19, 2020–May 9, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/pictures-revisited,"A deep dive into The Met's rich collection of contemporary photography, Pictures, Revisited reassesses the legacy of visual appropriation at the Museum and beyond. The images in this show are snipped from magazines, staged, or copied outright from other artworks. Like the works in this exhibition, the show itself is a sort of remix; on the occasion of the Museum's 150th anniversary, it provocatively expands and reimagines The Met's landmark 2009 exhibition, The Pictures Generation, 1974–1984— the first major museum initiative to trace the evolution of visual appropriation through a network of practitioners including Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, and Sarah Charlesworth. Drawing equally from pop culture and art history, the artists manipulated familiar photographs, ads, logos, and tropes, decontextualizing and reusing this imagery to upend traditional notions of authorship. Responding to a media landscape ever more saturated with images, they reached a conclusion which in our digital age seems obvious: where pictures once documented reality, they now replace it. More than a decade later, Pictures, Revisited situates their work in an expanded field. Of the tightly knit group of American artists who formed the first ""Pictures Generation,"" five are represented here. They appear alongside key predecessors and contemporaries, as well as artists for whom the ""Pictures"" approach was a critical influence. This exhibition considers the many legacies of appropriation, manifest at times in collage and archival projects, and in theatrically staged photographs that test the limits of cliché. Seen together, these strategies suggest an antidote to the anxiety of influence—that fear that there is nothing new under the sun. In a world increasingly mediated by images, perhaps there is no such thing as an original picture."
2021,Goya’s Graphic Imagination,"February 12–May 2, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/goyas-graphic-imagination,"Regarded as one of the most remarkable artists from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Francisco Goya (1746–1828) is renowned for his prolific activity as a draftsman and printmaker, producing about nine hundred drawings and three hundred prints during his long career. Through his drawings and prints, he expressed his political liberalism, criticism of superstition, and distaste for intellectual oppression in unique and compelling ways. This exhibition will explore Goya's graphic imagination and how his drawings and prints allowed him to share his complex ideas and respond to the turbulent social and political changes occurring in the world around him. The broadly chronological presentation will follow Goya's evolution and different phases as a graphic artist as well as his approaches to his subjects. Around one hundred works on display will come mainly from The Met collection—one of the most outstanding collections of Goya's drawings and prints outside Spain—with other works coming from New York, Boston, and Madrid’s Museo Nacional del Prado and the Biblioteca Nacional.

Each illustrates important aspects of a remarkable history and highlights how the department has been shaped by collectors, artistic practice, the art-historical canon, and the Museum’s connection to New York. This third installation features works that relate to New York’s history and urban development, its iconic monuments and skyline views, the people who call it home, and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Many of the artworks on display represent reflections of and reactions to New York as a physical place of residence and refuge. Others capture the city’s more metaphysical characterizations, made famous, for instance, by Frank Sinatra’s song “New York, New York.” Lyrics such as “a city that doesn’t sleep” and “if I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere” aptly express the bifurcated nature of the New York experience as one of excitement and chaos, opportunity, and hardship."

The Museum's archaeologists uncovered two-story houses, painted tombs, and a church. They also retrieved objects that reveal the multiple cultural and religious identities of the people who lived in the region. The finds represent a society between the third and seventh centuries A.D., a time of transition between the Roman and early Byzantine periods, which integrated Egyptian, Greek, and Roman culture and art. This exhibition features some thirty works from these excavations. By grouping objects according to the archaeological context in which they were discovered, the exhibition explores the interpretation of ancient identities and artifacts and shows how archaeological documentation can assist in understanding an object's original function. On view are ceramics, ostraca (pottery shards used as writing surfaces), jewelry from burials, glassware, coins, copies of frescoes with early Christian images, and early twentieth-century site photography.

2021,P.S. Art 2020: Celebrating the Creative Spirit of New York City Kids,"October 8, 2020–February 14, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/ps-art-2020,"P.S. Art is an annual celebration of achievement in the arts in New York City public schools. This juried exhibition of work created during the 2019–20 school year by talented young artists showcases the creativity of 122 prekindergarten through grade 12 students from all five boroughs, including students from District 75, a citywide district serving students with disabilities. The exhibition consists of paintings, prints, sculptures, photographs, mixed-media works, collages, and drawings. Each work of art demonstrates personal expression, imaginative use of media, the results of close observation, and an understanding of artistic processes. Dedicated art teachers encourage students to look closely at their worlds and respond creatively through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and learn to harness their imaginations for artistic expression. A panel of arts specialists from the New York City Department of Education and Studio in a School selected 348 semifinalists from more than 1,100 submissions. A jury of distinguished members of the City's arts community, including staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, chose the works on display in P.S. Art 2020 . This exhibition celebrates the students' journeys and discoveries from early childhood to young adulthood. Interspersed among the actual works on view are a number of labels with reproductions of works—a poignant reminder of the challenges faced in the creation of this year's exhibition due to the global pandemic. We will place the missing works on view as we receive them. See also the exhibition catalogue produced by Studio in a School. The New York City Department of Education would like to thank The Metropolitan Museum of Art for generously mounting, hosting, and helping to select works for this exhibition in the Ruth and Harold D.

2021,About Time: Fashion and Duration,"October 29, 2020–February 7, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/about-time,"Watch a longer preview featuring additional looks from the exhibition on The Met's YouTube channel. The Costume Institute's 2020 exhibition traces a century and a half of fashion—from 1870 to the present—along a disruptive timeline, on the occasion of The Met's 150th anniversary. Employing Henri Bergson's concept of la durée (duration), it explores how clothes generate temporal associations that conflate past, present, and future. Virginia Woolf serves as the ""ghost narrator"" of the exhibition. The timeline unfolds in two adjacent galleries fabricated as enormous clock faces and organized around the principle of 60 minutes of fashion. Each ""minute"" features a pair of garments, with the primary work representing the linear nature of fashion and the secondary work its cyclical character. To illustrate Bergson’s concept of duration—of the past co-existing with the present—the works in each pair are connected through shape, motif, material, pattern, technique, or decoration. For example, a black silk faille princess-line dress from the late 1870s is paired with an Alexander McQueen ""Bumster"" skirt from 1995. A black silk satin dress with enormous leg-o’-mutton sleeves from the mid-1890s is juxtaposed with a Comme des Garçons deconstructed ensemble from 2004. All of the garments are black to emphasize changes in silhouette, except at the conclusion of the show, where a white dress from Viktor & Rolf’s spring/summer 2020 haute couture collection, made from upcycled swatches in a patchwork design, serves as a symbol for the future of fashion with its emphasis on community, collaboration, and sustainability.

2021,Kyoto: Capital of Artistic Imagination,"July 24, 2019–January 31, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/kyoto-capital-artistic-imagination,"Focusing on the main turning points in the cultural history of Kyoto from ancient to modern times, Kyoto: Capital of Artistic Imagination places special emphasis on the decorative arts. Over eighty masterworks of lacquers, ceramics, metalwork, and textiles from The Met collection, including a number of recently acquired works of contemporary art are showcased. A selection of over fifty paintings by masters of various schools are accompanied by a rare fourteenth-century suit of armor, splendid export lacquers made for the European market in the late sixteenth-century, exquisite eighteenth-century Noh robes, as well as austere tea wares with characteristic imperfections. Heian-kyÅ, as modern-day Kyoto was once referred to, became the seat of the imperial court in 794 and remained the capital of Japan until 1869, when the court was transferred to Tokyo. The rich cultural heritage of this city was profoundly shaped by the presence of the emperor and aristocrats as well as high-ranking warriors, varied groups of artists, and literati working in the orbit of the palace. Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, Noh theaters, workshops of painters and lacquer artists, ceramic kilns, textile shops, a flourishing tea culture, and bustling market districts, as well as supremely elegant architecture and gardens contributed to the advancement of the vibrant cultural life of Kyoto. The exhibition is made possible by The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Foundation Fund."
2021,Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints: Anniversary Highlights,"October 8, 2020–January 18, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/drawings-prints-anniversary-highlights,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. During the celebration of the Museum's 150th anniversary, the Department of Drawings and Prints will present four thematic installations that take an in-depth look at the fabric of its collections. This second installation showcases a selection of highlights from the departmentâs collection of one million works on paper. The drawings, prints, and books on view were created over the span of five hundred years by celebrated artists active in Europe and the United States. Arranged in the gallery by theme, the works represent subjects that have been favored in the art world for centuries. Their juxtapositionâsuch as the pairing of still lifes by Paul CÃ©zanne and Pablo Picasso, or head studies by Leonardo da Vinci and Ford Madox Brownâexposes how different artists engaged with a particular theme. Together, the selected works tell a larger story about the evolution and continuities in our appreciation of composition, style, technique, and subject matter."
2021,Gerhard Richter: The Birkenau Paintings,"September 5, 2020–January 18, 2021",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/birkenau-gerhard-richter,"Gerhard Richter: The Birkenau Paintings is a focused installation that brings together the four canvases of this landmark series alongside an earlier work in glass, Mirror, Blood Red (1991). The German artist Gerhard Richter (b. 1932) has explored the material, conceptual, and historical implications of painting throughout his six-decade career. The Birkenau series (2014) encapsulates his long-standing interest in art's ability to reckon with issues of identity and collective memory, particularly in the context of post–World War II Germany. In the four paintings, Richter confronts the question of whether—and how—art is able to address the history of the Holocaust. The Birkenau paintings are based on four photographs secretly taken in the death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau. After a yearlong attempt to render the photographic images, Richter gradually veiled his initial figurative drawings with color, scouring each coat of paint with a squeegee to produce layered, ruptured surfaces. The canvases' distinctive facture and relatively subdued palette reflect the artist's conscious struggle to address the grim documents of historical trauma while curtailing the spectacular nature of the reproduced photograph. Together, the series holds in tension the complex relationship between representation and abstraction, and the opposing forces of destruction and reconstruction. #MetRichter The Birkenau series served as the conceptual core of Gerhard Richter: Painting After All , at The Met Breuer, which marked the first time the works had been seen in the United States. That exhibition was originally scheduled to run from March 4 through July 5, 2020, but closed on March 12 due to the COVID-19 crisis. 360º Exhibition Walkthrough | Gerhard Richter: Painting After All Learn more about how the Birkenau series was created in the Gerhard Richter: Painting After All Primer .

Rather than prioritizing accurate anatomical renderings, artists sought to capture the ""life energy"" of their subjects. This exhibition explores sophisticated decorative arts that depict figures dating to late imperial China, from the Song (960–1279) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Over this thousand-year period, images of humans, legendary figures, and immortals frequently appeared. The first gallery focuses on children, a ubiquitous and long-standing motif expressing the cultural importance of offspring. The second gallery displays scenes from idealized daily life, historical novels, and legends. Various religious figures from Buddhism and Daoism are presented in the third gallery. Some of the objects in this exhibition are recognized masterpieces, while others are little known and have not been on view for decades. Mainly drawn from The Met collection, this exhibition showcases diverse media, including textiles, lacquer, jade, ceramic, wood, bamboo, and metalwork.

But in 1974, Senegalese scholar and humanist Cheikh Anta Diop shocked and challenged historians by asserting the influence of ancient African civilizations in his groundbreaking bookThe African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality. This exhibition pays homage to Diop by presenting masterpieces from the Museum’s collections from west and central Africa alongside art from ancient Egypt for the first time in The Met’s history. Through twenty-one pairings of works from different African cultures and eras, this exhibition provides a rare opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary creativity of the continent across five millennia, revealing unexpected parallels and contrasts. Although there was no contact between their creators, the works share deep and underrecognized histories.

2022,The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Met,"May 24, 2021–January 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/good-life-collecting-late-antique-art,"The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Metshowcases the Museum’s important and rare collection of third- to eighth-century art from Egypt and reevaluates it through the lens of late antique ideas about abundance, virtue, and shared classical taste. Writers and craftspeople translated these ideas into a concept celebrated as the “the good life.” Anchored by crucial gifts to The Met of late antique art, the exhibition explores themes connected to social status, wealth, and living well in Late Antiquity. The core of The Met’s collection from late antique Egypt was formed through public subscriptions and generous gifts in the 1890s. The first decades after the Museum’s founding was a time when profound interest in the earliest Christian art inspired scholars, collectors, and the public alike. Today, The Met continues to collect late antique art that reveals the burgeoning of literary and visual representations of a life well lived. This exhibition highlights The Met’s holdings of late antique textiles, decorative arts, jewelry, and sculpture—all highly prized by elite patrons of the Byzantine Empire’s southern provinces in Africa. The works of art featured in the exhibition reflect the extraordinary wealth of Mediterranean Africa. In addition to marking status, these objects responded to such fundamental questions as, What does it mean to “live well”? During the period, ideas about “the good life” intersected with issues of religion, identity, and relationships with the past. As a result, these objects not only testify to The Met’s long-standing interest in late antique art of the region but also shed light on some of the aspirations, values, and lifestyles of its upper classes. #MetByzantine The exhibition is made possible by The Giorgi Family Foundation."
2022,Jegi: Korean Ritual Objects,"August 6, 2022–October 11, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/jegi-korean-ritual-objects,"Rituals and customs help celebrate life’s milestones, remember the past, and mark time. In addition to their significance as social conventions, rituals often reaffirm state, governmental, and religious principles. In Korea, performing ancestral rites (jesa) is an enduring tradition that embodies respect for parents and the commemoration of ancestors, key tenets of Confucianism. During the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910), Neo-Confucianism was the ruling ideology. People engaged in rituals on the birth and death anniversaries for ancestors upward of five generations, and on major holidays, such as the Lunar New Year and Chuseok (Harvest Moon Festival). Court ancestral rites became the bedrock of Joseon political life and were enacted on a grand scale that included musical and dance performances. A key feature throughout was a table bearing food and drink offerings presented onjegi, or ritual objects. This exhibition features the various types of ritual vessels and accessories that were used for this purpose and entombed, as well as the kinds of musical instruments played at state events.

This exhibition brings together some of the Museum's greatest paintings to present this remarkable chapter of art history in a new light. Through sixty-seven works of art organized thematically,In Praise of Paintingorients visitors to key issues in seventeenth-century Dutch culture—from debates about religion and conspicuous consumption to painters' fascination with the domestic lives of women. The exhibition provides a fresh perspective on the canon and parameters of the Dutch Golden Age by uniting paintings from Benjamin Altman's bequest, the Robert Lehman Collection, and the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection. Works typically displayed separately in the Museum's galleries—such as Rembrandt'sGerard de Lairesseand Lairesse's ownApollo and Aurora—are presented side by side, producing a visually compelling narrative about the tensions between realism and idealism during this period. The presentation also provides the opportunity to conserve and display rarely exhibited paintings, including Margareta Haverman'sA Vase of Flowers—one of only two known paintings by the artist and the only painting by an early modern Dutch woman currently in The Met collection. The exhibition takes its title from one of the period's major works of art theory, Philips Angel'sThe Praise of Painting(1642), a pioneering defense of realism in art.

InLives of the Gods: Divinity in Maya Art, rarely seen masterpieces and recent discoveries trace the life cycle of the gods, from the moment of their creation in a sacred mountain to their dazzling transformations as blossoming flowers or fearsome creatures of the night. Maya artists, who lived in what is now Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, depicted the gods in imaginative ways from the monumental to the miniature—from exquisitely carved, towering sculptures to jade, shell, and obsidian ornaments that adorned kings and queens, connecting them symbolically to supernatural forces.

2022,Water Memories,"June 23, 2022–April 2, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/water-memories,"Water is the most intimate of all natural resources. We depend on and share our lives with water in its many forms—the soothing trickle of freshwater springs, meandering rivers, the rhythmic waves of a northern Great Lake, the thunderous roar of the ocean, and even debilitating droughts. Water reflects our emotions, awakens the senses, and excites imagination. Across the world, water conservation is a timely and urgent subject. This exhibition explores water’s significance to Indigenous peoples and Nations in the United States through historical, modern, and contemporary artworks. In four thematic sections—Ancestral Connections, Water and Sky, Forests and Streams, and Oceanic Imaginations—diverse aquatic expressions feature both representational and abstract approaches. The variety of items on view—protest fashion, hand-carved children’s toys, glass lamps, oil paintings, photographs, and video—create a current of memories belonging to Native American and non-Native artists. Throughout the exhibition, contemporary Indigenous community members provide individual interpretations and share their personal associations with water. The works collectively reveal how—across time and place—water provides nourishment, sanctuary, and healing while also activating protest, conflict, and complex dialogue.

Each shield protects against “nonlethal” police munitions—such as rubber bullets and truncheons—weaponized against Water Protectors. The reflective mirror is also defensive, aimed at showing police an image of themselves in hopes of reaching their humanity and making them less violent. The shields speak to a universal humanity grounded in Indigenous values: we all need water to live.—Nick Estes (Kul Wicasa/Lower Brule Sioux Tribe) On-site performance organized in collaboration with Rory Wakemup; morning prayer sung by the Oceti Sakowin main camp announcer; video courtesy of Ginger Dunnill and Cannupa Hanska Luger.

2022,Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color,"July 5, 2022–March 26, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/chroma,"Ancient Greek and Roman sculpture was once colorful, vibrantly painted and richly adorned with detailed ornamentation.Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Colorreveals the colorful backstory of polychromy—meaning “many colors,” in Greek—and presents new discoveries of surviving ancient color on artworks in The Met’s world-class collection. Exploring the practices and materials used in ancient polychromy, the exhibition highlights cutting-edge scientific methods used to identify ancient color and examines how color helped convey meaning in antiquity, and how ancient polychromy has been viewed and understood in later periods.The exhibition features a series of reconstructions of ancient sculptures in color by Prof. Dr. V. Brinkmann, Head of the Department of Antiquity at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung, and Dr. U. Koch-Brinkmann, and introduces a new reconstruction of The Met’s Archaic-period Sphinx finial, completed by The Liebieghaus team in collaboration with The Met.Presented alongside original Greek and Roman works representing similar subjects, the reconstructions are the result of a wide array of analytical techniques, including 3D imaging and rigorous art historical research. Polychromy is a significant area of study for The Met, and the Museum has a long history of investigating, preserving, and presenting manifestations of original color on ancient statuary. The exhibition is made possible by the Aretê Foundation/Betsy and Ed Cohen. Additional support is provided by Mary Jaharis and Cathrin M. Stickney and Mark P. Gorenberg. This exhibition is organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, in collaboration with the Liebieghaus Sculpture Collection, Frankfurt am Main."
2022,A New Look at Old Masters,"December 12, 2020–March 26, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/a-new-look-at-old-masters,"A New Look at Old Masterswill explore a variety of themes in The Met’s collection of European painting, creating new dialogues among the works and including a large presentation of sculpture. While one gallery will highlight the creation of still life and genre painting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, two others will provide an overview of oil sketches from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, leading up to the Museum's unsurpassed collection of works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. A large gallery will display portraiture in the Grand Siècle, juxtaposing outstanding paintings by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck with Charles Le Brun’s monumental family portrait of the banker Everhard Jabach. The eighteenth-century French galleries will take up such themes as the study of expression, François Boucher and the decorative arts, and the role of female artists, who finally found a place in the academy. The Met’s unique collection of French Neoclassical painting, dominated by gifts fromJayne Wrightsman, will be installed with sculptured busts by Jean Antoine Houdon of the essential figures of the Enlightenment: Denis Diderot and Voltaire. These are just a few examples of the novel themes that will be on display. A New Look at Old Mastersis part of theEuropean Paintings Skylights Projectand is a prelude to the final, expansive re-installation of the European Paintings galleries that will take place after the project is completed."
2022,Fictions of Emancipation: Carpeaux Recast,"March 10, 2022–March 5, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/carpeaux-recast,"Organized around a single object—the marble bustWhy Born Enslaved!by French sculptor Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux—Fictions of Emancipation: Carpeaux Recastis the first exhibition at The Met to examine Western sculpture in relation to the histories of transatlantic slavery, colonialism, and empire. Created in the wake of American emancipation and some twenty years after the abolition of slavery in the French Atlantic,Why Born Enslaved!was shaped by the enduring popularity of antislavery imagery, the development of nineteenth-century ethnographic theories of racial difference, and France’s colonialist fascination with Africa. The exhibition will explore the sculpture’s place within these contexts. Featuring more than thirty-five works of art in sections unfolding around Carpeaux’s sculpture,Fictions of Emancipationwill offer an in-depth look at portrayals of Black enslavement, emancipation, and personhood with an aim toward challenging the notion that representation in the wake of abolition constitutes a clear moral or political stance. Important works by Josiah Wedgwood, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, Charles Cordier, Edmonia Lewis, Louis-Simon Boizot, and others will show how Western artists of the nineteenth century engaged with the Black figure as a political symbol and site of exoticized beauty, while contemporary sculptures by Kara Walker and Kehinde Wiley will connect the dialogue around Carpeaux’s bust to current conversations about the legacies of slavery in the Western world. This exhibition was conceived in collaboration with guest curator Wendy S. Walters and enriched through conversations with numerous intellectual partners. It is one of many projects that the Museum is undertaking in an effort to reassess and broaden the narratives it presents about the past and present. Accompanied by a publication. The exhibition is made possible by the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Foundation. Additional support is provided by Allen R. Adler and Frances F. L. Beatty. The catalogue is made possible by The Met’s Fund for Diverse Art Histories, Mary J. Wallach, Robert E. Holmes, and the Ford Foundation."
2022,Crossings,"October 27, 2022–February 28, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/crossings,"On view in the American Wing Gallery 767 through February 28, 2023 is a special display,Crossings, that explores ongoing resonances between past and present artistic expressions—specifically, modern and contemporary responses to Emanuel Leutze’s epicWashington Crossing the Delaware(1851). Evoking patriotic feelings in some viewers, conflict and struggle in others, this commanding icon—an unavoidable highlight of The Met’s American Wing—continues to spark debates about political ideas. In the more than century and a half since Leutze painted the canvas, several artists—especially those of color—have responded to the contrived subject, from Black AmericansJacob Lawrence, Robert Colescott, and Kara Walker to Indigenous (Cree)Kent Monkman. Each of their works confronts the biases of American history and mythmaking, while revealing the critical role art plays in shaping popular narratives. Colescott’s subversive take, painted in anticipation of the nation’s bicentennial, places the trailblazing scientist, inventor, and African American hero George Washington Carver at the helm of a boatload of Black stereotypes. The satire challenges viewers to accept the insidiousness of racism in popular culture as well as the urgency of truthful histories. Indebted to Colescott’s example, Walker’sThe Crossing(2017) interrogates U.S. power and patriotism in ways ever more relevant since the violent attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The diptych responds to two paintings at The Met that address the realities of a precarious ship of state, the Leutze and Winslow Homer’sThe Gulf Stream(1899, reworked by 1906). This intervention is the second part ofa contemporary codato The Met’s recent exhibitionWinslow Homer: Crosscurrents, now on view in reduced form at London’s National Gallery. While many of our Homers are on loan, others may be found in American Wing galleries 762 and 769."
2022,Kimono Style: The John C. Weber Collection,"June 7, 2022–February 20, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/kimono-style,"This exhibition will trace the transformation of the kimono from the late Edo period (1615–1868) through the early 20th century, as the T-shaped garment was adapted to suit the lifestyle of modern Japanese women. It will feature a remarkable selection of works from the renowned John C. Weber Collection of Japanese art that explore the mutual artistic exchanges between the kimono and Western fashion, as well as highlights from The Costume Institute’s collection. The weaving, dyeing, and embroidery techniques for which Japan is famed reached their peak of artistic sophistication during the Edo period. Members of the ruling military class were the primary consumers of sumptuous kimono, each one being custom-made. At the same time, a dynamic urban culture emerged, and the merchant class used its wealth to acquire material luxuries. Kimono, one of the most visible art forms, provided a way for the townspeople to proclaim their aesthetic sensibility. Depictions of kimono in Japanese woodblock prints were widely studied by Western couturiers in the late 19th century. The garment’s comparatively loose, enveloping silhouette, and its rectilinear cut would have the most profound and lasting influence on Western fashion, with couturiers like Madeleine Vionnet and Cristóbal Balenciaga taking inspiration from the kimono for their avant-garde creations. In the Meiji period (1868–1912), Western clothing was introduced to Japan. Simultaneously, modernization and social changes enabled more women to gain access to silk kimonos than ever before. Around the 1920s, affordable ready-to-wear kimono (meisen) became very popular and reflected a more Westernized lifestyle. These were sold in department stores modelled on Western retailers, following Western-style marketing strategies. To illustrate these connections, the exhibition will present over 60 kimonos alongside Western garments, paintings, prints, and decorative art objects. Accompanied by a catalogue. The exhibition is made possible by the Mary Livingston Griggs and Mary Griggs Burke Foundation Fund, 2015. The catalogue is made possible by the Florence and Herbert Irving Fund for Asian Art Publications. Additional support is provided by the Richard and Geneva Hofheimer Memorial Fund."
2022,The Power of Portraiture: Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints,"October 13, 2022–February 7, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-power-of-portraiture,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to 100 objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. Featuring a dazzling selection of prints and drawings ranging in date from the early seventeenth century to the present and including several new acquisitions, the current installation explores themes of artistic lineage and homage with a primary focus on portraiture. At its heart are works by members of Black Women of Print, a collective founded by Tanekeya Word to promote the visibility of Black women printmakers and create an equitable future within the discipline of printmaking. These dynamic images pay tribute to earlier Black women artists, among them Elizabeth Catlett and Emma Amos, whose works are also on view. Their prints, along with those by Lorna Simpson, Charles White, Fred Wilson, and John Wilson, reveal the expressive potential of portraiture. By depicting both anonymous sitters and well-known figures such as Malcolm X, Lena Horne, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., these artists call attention to the relationship of representation and power. Willie Cole’s monumental works further extend the boundaries of the genre, using steam irons and ironing boards to point to histories of unrecognized labor. Placed in dialogue with Cole’s prints are earlier images of European street vendors and of women engaged in domestic work, revealing the ample but ultimately partial vision of labor put forth by the Western pictorial tradition. Also featured in this rotation is a selection of woodland drawings by artists active in Central Europe between the late eighteenth century and the early twentieth. Together with depictions of narrative subjects set in the woods, these works demonstrate the appeal of the forest as a vehicle for the study of light and color and as a subject embedded with rich associations. Finally, a group of witchcraft scenes by Jacques de Gheyn II, Giovanni David, Francisco de Goya, Eugène Delacroix, and Odilon Redon trace the evolution of nightmare imagery—and the complicated societal values it reflects and perpetuates—across nearly three centuries."

2022,Noble Virtues: Nature as Symbol in Chinese Art,"September 10, 2022–January 29, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/noble-virtues,"Flowers, plants, and animals abound in Chinese art. From simple objects for the home to fancy vessels for the imperial court, popular prints to meticulously crafted paintings, manifestations of the natural world are found nearly everywhere. Sometimes these images are purely decorative, but often they carry meanings drawn from history, poetry, and cultural memory. Bamboo, for instance, which bends in the cold wind without breaking, can be a symbol of the virtuous person withstanding hard times; the plum blossom, which dares to bloom in the chill of early spring, an emblem of righteous bravery. For artists and viewers alike, associations such as these added layers of depth to an artwork. In this way, a vignette of the natural world could become a celebration of life, a wish for good fortune, or even a defiant act of protest. This exhibition, drawn primarily from The Met collection, introduces some of these themes through over 100 works of painting, calligraphy, and decorative arts. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2022,Cubism and the Trompe l’Oeil Tradition,"October 20, 2022–January 22, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/cubism-trompe-loeil,"This exhibition will offer a radically new view of Cubism by demonstrating its engagement with the age-old tradition of trompe l’oeil painting. A self-referential art concerned with the nature of representation, trompe l’oeil (“deceive the eye”) beguiles the viewer with perceptual and psychological games that complicate definitions of truth and fiction. Many qualities seen as distinct to Cubism were, in fact, exploited by trompe l’oeil specialists over the centuries: the emphatically flat picture plane; the invasion of the “real” world into the pictorial one; the mimicry of materials; and the inclusion of new print media and advertising replete with coded references to artist, patron, and current events. In a contest of creative one-upmanship, the Cubists Georges Braque, Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso both parodied classic trompe l’oeil devices and invented new ways of confounding the viewer. Along with Cubist paintings, sculptures, and collages, the exhibition will present canonical examples of European and American trompe l’oeil painting from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries.

2022,Celebrating the Year of the Tiger,"January 29, 2022–January 17, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/year-of-the-tiger,"The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating twelve-year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac. The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century B.C. and became firmly established by the first century A.D. The twelve animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of people born in that year. February 1, 2022, marks the beginning of the Year of the Tiger, a creature characterized as brave, heroic, resolute, and vigorous. Tigers have been a prominent artistic subject since ancient times. Symbols of power and authority, they are often seen on the sacred ritual vessels of the Shang (ca. 1600–1046 B.C.) and Zhou (1046–256 B.C.) dynasties. During the late Zhou and Han (206 B.C.–A.D. 220) dynasties, rulers delegated military command to officers using tiger-shaped bronze tallies. Depictions of tigers permeate almost all aspects of Chinese culture. For example, the tiger symbolizes the western quadrant of the four cardinal directions. It is regarded as the king of all wild animals and used on military banners to illustrate bravery and swiftness. In Chinese folklore, the tiger is a protective deity able to dispel harmful spirits. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund.

2022,The Tudors: Art and Majesty in Renaissance England,"October 10, 2022–January 8, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/tudors,"England under the volatile Tudor dynasty was a thriving home for the arts. An international community of artists and merchants, many of them religious refugees, navigated the high-stakes demands of royal patrons, including England’s first two reigning queens. Against the backdrop of shifting political relationships with mainland Europe, Tudor artistic patronage legitimized, promoted, and stabilized a series of tumultuous reigns, from Henry VII’s seizure of the throne in 1485 to the death of his granddaughter Elizabeth I in 1603. The Tudor courts were truly cosmopolitan, boasting the work of Florentine sculptors, German painters, Flemish weavers, and Europe’s best armorers, goldsmiths, and printers, while also contributing to the emergence of a distinctly English style. This exhibition will trace the transformation of the arts in Tudor England through more than 100 objects—including iconic portraits, spectacular tapestries, manuscripts, sculpture, and armor—from both The Met collection and international lenders.

2022,"Past/Present/Future: Expanding Indigenous American, Latinx, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander Perspectives in Thomas J. Watson Library","September 22, 2022–January 3, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/past-present-future,"Past/Present/Futureis the culminating exhibition to Thomas J. Watson Library's grant project funded by theNational Endowment for the Humanities, which aimed to assess and expand the library's collection of underrepresented heritage groups, especially Indigenous American, Latinx, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander artists. While it is impossible to apply a single definition or category to all the acquired titles, many explore a suspension or intervention of temporality, bound together by shared themes of colonialism, land sovereignty, reclamation, and reconciliation. Thus, the titles selected here present artists whose work confronts the past, reconciles the present, and draws out new possibilities for the future of historically marginalized people in the United States. This selection also mirrors Watson Library's own endeavors to build a diverse body of perspectives and resources dedicated to the study of visual art by confronting what has been overlooked in the past, addressing it in our present moment, and mapping out a future where the collection better aligns with its values and purposes. The selected titles were gathered together through the joint effort of the project’s research associates and bibliographers Amanda Raquel Dorval, Anna Lee, and Louisa Raitt. Watson Library’s NEH Grant Project ran between October 2021 and December 2022, with catalogers Helice Koffler and Kim Ross; library associates Mia Ciallella, Raymond Lei, and Lo Traster-Lee; and led by Jared Ash, Florence and Herbert Irving Collections Librarian. This exhibition has been made possible in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities: Sustaining the Humanities through the American Rescue Plan, as part of an initiative to assess, expand, and promote access to the library’s collection of publications by and about Indigenous American, Latinx, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander artists.Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this exhibition do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities."
2022,Bernd & Hilla Becher,"July 15–November 6, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/becher,"The renowned German artists Bernd and Hilla Becher (1931–2007; 1934–2015) changed the course of late twentieth-century photography. Working as a rare artist couple, they focused on a single subject: the disappearing industrial architecture of Western Europe and North America that fueled the modern era. Their seemingly objective style recalled nineteenth- and early twentieth-century precedents but also resonated with the serial approach of contemporary Minimalism and Conceptual art. Equally significant, it challenged the perceived gap between documentary and fine-art photography. Using a large-format view camera, the Bechers methodically recorded blast furnaces, winding towers, grain silos, cooling towers, and gas tanks with precision, elegance, and passion. Their rigorous, standardized practice allowed for comparative analyses of structures that they exhibited in grids of between four and thirty photographs. They described these formal arrangements as “typologies” and the buildings themselves as “anonymous sculpture.”This posthumous retrospective celebrates the Bechers’ remarkable achievement and is the first ever organized with full access to the artists’ personal collection of working materials and their comprehensive archive. The exhibition is made possible by Joyce Frank Menschel, the Barrie A. and Deedee Wigmore Foundation, the Edward John & Patricia Rosenwald Foundation, and Linda Macklowe.It is organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, in association with Studio Bernd & Hilla Becher and Die Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kultur.

2022,The Lightning Testimonies,"February 28–November 6, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/lightning-testimonies,"Amar Kanwar'sThe Lightning Testimonies(2007) is an installation of eight synchronized video projections that play on a thirty-two-minute loop. The work is a constellation of accounts of women who have experienced sexual violence. Beginning with the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, it spans several regions and communities and ends with the historic anti-rape protests in Manipur in 2004. Extensive research by the artist included talking to women’s relatives as well as to activists, scholars, lawyers and community members. Each narration, rendered in the installation through text in English, appears on multiple screens. The work combines contemporary and archival footage, none of it graphic in nature to reveal multiple submerged narratives, sometimes in people, images, and the recounting of memories, and at other times in objects from nature and everyday life that stand as silent but surviving witnesses. Accompanied by a soundtrack of understated music and ambient sound, the accounts converge into a single projection, when spoken voice is heard for the first time. In all the stories, the body becomes central—as a site for honor, hatred, and humiliation, and also for dignity and protest. Through its multitude of voices the work contests official histories and links diverse episodes to expose how rape functions as a means of social repression. Using a range of visual vocabularies,The Lightning Testimonieshopes to transport us beyond the realm of suffering into a space of quiet contemplation, where resilience creates the potential for transformation.Since its completion, Kanwar has exhibited the work internationally and also presented it within the communities affected by this history of violence. The exhibition is made possible by The Modern Circle."
2022,"Bodhisattvas of Wisdom, Compassion, and Power","March 27, 2021–October 30, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/bodhisattvas-wisdom-compassion-power,"Within the Buddhist traditions of the Himalayas, three bodhisattvas emerge as personifications of Buddhist ideals. Manjushri, who cuts through ignorance and personifies correct knowledge; Avalokiteshvara, a compassionate protector of the devout that helps reveal the true nature of reality; and Vajrapani as the embodiment of the energy of enlightenment. Focusing on dramatic images, a worshipper could first evoke the subtle knowledge that Manjushri personifies, then with Avalokiteshvara’s aid, it is possible to proceed in a way free from self-imposed delusions, while Vajrapani’s transcendent power aids in destroying jealousy and hatred that stand in the way of enlightenment. Venerating these three bodhisattvas together has a long history, and they play an essential role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet. This exhibition draws together a dramatic group of paintings, sculptures, ritual objects, and illustrated manuscripts from the eleventh to eighteenth centuries, made primarily for Nepal and Tibet’s monastic institutions. Beautifully cast sculptures and accessible paintings showing peaceful manifestations of the bodhisattvas intended for the public are juxtaposed with complex tantric images of the highest quality done in portable media made for monastic elites. Vajrayana images offered powerful ways to access these bodhisattvas as a personal path to enlightenment, though often undertaking such rituals was done with a ruler’s sponsorship for the people’s benefit. This exhibition presents some of the sublime representations of these three bodhisattvas at the center of this great devotional tradition embraced across the Himalayas. The exhibition is made possible by The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Foundation Fund."

This exhibition of over 150 works dating from the early 1880s to the early 1950s, features a selection from the recent gift to The Met by scholar Martin Eidelberg. This collection includes works of extraordinary diversity—with stylized decoration, often jewel-like glazes, and even displays of whimsy. Together, they illuminate the impressive accomplishments of American potteries and ceramists from cities across the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Emphasized throughout the exhibition are the creations of women artists, who had newly moved into professional pottery during this time, including works with exquisite carved decoration by such pioneering artists as Adelaide Alsop Robineau, who worked in porcelain and developed lustrous crystalline glazes. Other artists include Louis C. Tiffany and his nature-inspired vessels; the eccentric potter George E. Ohr, from Biloxi, Mississippi; and Artus Van Briggle and his wife Anna Van Briggle, with their Art Nouveau and Symbolist-inspired work in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Between the wars, talented émigré ceramists adapted prevailing styles from their countries and produced work often in a modernist vein. A multiplicity of voices characterizes this era of American ceramics with new styles, new materials, and new techniques all on display. The exhibition is made possible by the Frank H. & Eva B. Buck Foundation. The catalogue is made possible by the William Cullen Bryant Fellows of The Metropolitan Museum of Art."

Art is an annual celebration of achievement in the arts in New York City public schools. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the exhibition and the fifteenth year it is hosted at The Met. This juried exhibition of 122 works of art by talented young artists showcases the creativity of prekindergarten through grade 12 students from all five boroughs, including students from District 75, a citywide district serving students with disabilities. The exhibition consists of collages, drawings, mixed-media works, paintings, photographs, prints, and sculpture. Each work of art demonstrates personal expression, imaginative use of media, the results of close observation, and an understanding of artistic processes.Dedicated art teachers support students’ creativity and help them look closely in order to respond to their worlds through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and learn to harness their imaginations for artistic expression. This exhibition celebrates the students’ journeys and discoveries from early childhood to young adulthood. Moreover, the work on view and accompanying student statements are a testament to the creativity and resilience of teachers working in their schools with students who had been working remotely or in hybrid environments for the past two years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.A panel of arts specialists from the Department of Education and Studio in a School selected 337 semifinalists from over eight hundred submissions. A jury of distinguished members of the New York City arts community, including staff of The Met, selected the works on view.The New York City Department of Education would like to thank The Metropolitan Museum of Art for generously mounting, hosting, and helping to select works for this exhibition in the Ruth and Harold D.

Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to 100 objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. This installation features newly acquired works by Vincent Van Gogh, Piet Mondrian, and Edvard Munch, alongside a selection of works by Dutch artists from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century. Sixteenth-century ornament drawings and prints from the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy will be on view as well as a group of designs for decorative arts and interiors. Images of birds from the late sixteenth to the twenty-first century and depictions of the Bay of Naples and Vesuvius will round out the display."
2022,In Full Bloom: Margaret Armstrong's Decorated Publishers' Bindings Revisited,"June 2–September 21, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/in-full-bloom,"Margaret Armstrong (1867–1944) was an author, book cover designer, field collector, and botanical illustrator. She was among the most influential designers of her time and a source of inspiration for other female book cover designers including Amy M. Sacker, Lee Thayer, and Marion Louise Peabody. Armstrong’s first book cover design, forSweet Williamby Marguerite Bouvet, was published in 1890. Early in her career she faced reluctance placing her designs with publishers, as the field of book cover design was dominated by men. To surmount this challenge, she signed her early submissions “M.N. Armstrong.” However, the years 1892–93 were groundbreaking for women book cover designers: several important exhibitions in prominent clubs and at the World’s Columbian Exposition featured women designers and paved the way for the success they enjoyed during the next decades. As Armstrong’s career as a book designer progressed, her designs became more fluid and individualized, reflecting the books’ subjects. With her increasingly colorful, striking book covers, she was in demand as a designer and worked for twenty-one different publishers, producing approximately 270 book cover designs. In Full Bloom: Margaret Armstrong's Decorated Publishers' Bindings Revisitedbrings back nearly all the books from Watson Library’s 2020 exhibitionSpring Blossoms: Margaret Armstrong’s Decorated Publishers’ Bindingsand includes over thirty additional titles. The exhibition features book covers designed by Armstrong from the 1890s to 1927, and highlights six themes: designs that invoke the patterns of stained glass; designs featuring flowers and plant forms; design variants; lesser-known designs; yellow and blue designs selected to honor the victims of the war in Ukraine; and the lavender series of publications by Myrtle Reed.

2022,In America: An Anthology of Fashion,"May 7–September 5, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/in-america-anthology,"The Costume Institute’sIn America: An Anthology of Fashionis the second portion of a two-part exhibition exploring fashion in the United States. Presented in collaboration with The Met’s American Wing, this section of the exhibition will highlight sartorial narratives that relate to the complex and layered histories of theAmerican Wing period rooms. Men’s and women’s dress dating from the eighteenth century to the present will be featured in vignettes installed in select period rooms spanning ca. 1805 to 1915: a Shaker Retiring Room from the 1830s; a nineteenth-century parlor from Richmond, Virginia; a panoramic 1819 mural of Versailles; and a twentieth-century living room designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, among others. These interiors display a survey of more than two hundred years of American domestic life and tell a variety of stories—from the personal to the political, the stylistic to the cultural, and the aesthetic to the ideological. The exhibition will reflect on these narratives through a series of three-dimensional cinematic “freeze frames” produced in collaboration with notable American film directors. These mise-en-scènes will explore the role of dress in shaping American identity and address the complex and layered histories of the rooms.

2022,Companions in Solitude: Reclusion and Communion in Chinese Art,"July 31, 2021–August 14, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/companions-in-solitude,"This exhibition will explore the twin themes of solitude and togetherness in Chinese art. For more than two thousand years, reclusion—removing oneself from society—has been presented as the ideal condition for mental cultivation and transcending worldly troubles. At the same time, communion with like-minded people has been celebrated as essential to the human experience. This choice, to be alone or to be together, has been central to the lives of thinkers and artists, and Chinese art abounds with images of figures who pursued both paths—as well as those who wove them together in complex and surprising ways.Companions in Solitude, presented in two rotations, will bring together more than 120 works of painting, calligraphy, and decorative arts that illuminate this choice—depictions of why and how people have sought space from the world or attempted to bridge the divide between themselves and others. In the wake of 2020, a year that has isolated us physically but connected us virtually in unprecedented ways, this exploration of premodern Chinese reclusion and communion will invite meditation on the fracture and facture of human connection in our own time.

While Bourgeois is best known today as a sculptor, it is in this early body of work—created in the decade spanning World War II—that her artistic voice emerged, establishing a core group of visual motifs that she would continue to explore and develop over the course of her celebrated, decades-long career. Informed by new archival research, the exhibition sheds light on a little-known chapter in the artist’s practice.

This exhibition reconsiders Homer’s work through the lens of conflict, a theme that crosses his prolific career. A persistent fascination with struggle permeates his art—from emblematic images of the Civil War and Reconstruction that examine the effects of the conflict on the landscape, soldiers, and formerly enslaved people to dramatic scenes of rescue and hunting as well as monumental seascapes and dazzling tropical works painted throughout the Atlantic world. The centerpiece of the exhibition is Homer’s iconicThe Gulf Stream, a painting that reveals his lifelong engagement with charged subjects of race, geopolitics, and the environment. Featuring 88 oils and watercolors,Crosscurrentsrepresents the largest critical overview of Homer’s art and life in more than a quarter of a century. Accompanied by a scholarly publication.

2022,Shell and Resin: Korean Mother-of-Pearl and Lacquer,"December 13, 2021–July 5, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/shell-and-resin,"Lacquerware with mother-of-pearl inlay has a long and rich tradition in the history of Korean art. This exhibition showcases nearly thirty outstanding works of Korean lacquerware from The Met collection and marks the Museum’s first exhibition dedicated solely to Korean lacquerware. The pieces are arranged thematically by motif to illustrate the technical and aesthetic development of the art form and acknowledge the greater Asian context through comparative examples of Chinese, Japanese, and Ryūkyū (Okinawan) lacquers and South Asian mother-of-pearl. The exhibition begins with a twelfth-century trefoil box, noteworthy for its rarity, exceptional technique, and intricate inlay, and follows the tradition to the present with contemporary works by master artists. Lacquer—an English word derived from the Portuguese word lacré (sealing wax)—refers to the toxic sap sourced from trees belonging to the Toxicodendron genus widely found in Korea, Japan, southern China, and Southeast Asia. When exposed to oxygen and humidity, lacquer hardens, or polymerizes, becoming a natural plastic and ideal protective covering. The term “mother-of-pearl” has been used since at least the sixteenth century to describe the lustrous material in the interior of some mollusks in many parts of the world. The exhibition explores the manner in which lacquer and mother-of-pearl are often paired yet have distinct materiality. The exhibition is made possible by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, The Republic of Korea (MCST)."

This year we are delighted to open this presentation of their work to the public. The wide range of artistic expression—from drawing, painting, and photography to sculpture and digital media—corresponds to an equally expansive representation of departments throughout the institution, including guards, educators, technicians, librarians, designers, engineers, conservators, volunteers, registrars, and many others.

2022,Charles Ray: Figure Ground,"January 31–June 5, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/charles-ray,"Charles Ray: Figure Groundpresents the work of one of the most important artists of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. For over five decades, Ray (born Chicago, 1953) has experimented with a wide range of methods, including performance, photography, and sculpture, the medium for which he is best recognized today. In the process, he has utilized a variety of materials, expanded the fundamental terms of sculptural language, and pioneered major advances in production, combining the analog and the digital as well as human and robotic hands. Additionally, Ray’s work addresses in elliptical, often irreverent ways not only art history, popular culture, and mass media but also identity, mortality, race, and gender. This exhibition unites sculptures from every period of Ray’s career with key photographs from the 1970s and 1980s, exploring central aspects of his challenging and sometimes provocative oeuvre. It also brings together for the first time all the works that Ray loosely patterned on Mark Twain’s 1885 novelAdventures of Huckleberry Finn. Located at The Met, whose collection the artist has studied closely for many years,Charles Ray: Figure Groundfeatures a suite of judiciously placed works whose arrangement in space forges subtle connections between objects and viewers. Similar to a scholar’s stone, which is meant to facilitate and prolong thoughtful contemplation, Ray’s sculpture poses many trenchant questions but answers none directly.

Beginning in the early 1970s, the Irvings built one of the most comprehensive and superb collections of Chinese art in the world. For more than three decades, the couple helped The Met acquire important artworks and provided support for exhibitions, and their passion was a factor in building the current exhibition galleries dedicated to Chinese decorative arts. Their generous gifts of more than five hundred exceptional objects fundamentally transformed the holdings of Chinese art at The Met.The approximately 120 works on display (in each rotation) cover almost all major categories of Chinese art, with a focus on three-dimensional objects, including lacquer, ceramic, metal work, jade, bamboo, and stone carvings. Created by both famous and unknown masters, these extraordinary works represent the artistic sophistication and technical virtuosity of Chinese decorative arts from the tenth through the early twentieth century. In addition to the Irvings’ well-known assemblage of lacquer ware, the exhibition also showcases their recent gifts of a group of jade and bamboo works from the eighteenth-century imperial workshop that have never before been on display.

Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in The Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. This installation highlights the broad range of accomplishments of artists working at the same time as French painter Jacques Louis David (1748–1825). Whether they emulated his manner or sought their own paths, shared his political beliefs or condemned them, artists of this period could hardly escape the impact of David’s work. Works on view by David’s peers, pupils, and rivals explore the creativity and capacity for transformation that marked this vital period that spanned the last years of the French monarchy, the Revolution, the rise of Napoleon, and ultimately, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. The fast pace of political change accentuated the intertwined nature of art and politics, which permeated all levels of artistic production—from large-scale paintings to the decorative arts and fashion—as this selection of drawings and prints attests. This display complements the exhibitionJacques Louis David: Radical Draftsmanin galleries 691-693 (February 17 – May 15, 2022)."

Through the lens of his preparatory studies, the exhibition looks beyond his public successes to chart the moments of inspiration and the progress of ideas.

The show explores the flourishing of photography as a medium between World War II and the Vietnam War and includes several mini-monographic presentations on a group of diverse photographers including Helen Levitt, Roy DeCarava, Mario De Biasi, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Don McCullin, and Aaron Rose. The exhibition features classic photographs seldom seen, acquisitions that the Museum has not yet exhibited, and magazines and books by Japanese photographers—also notable gifts to The Met and works of art in their own right. The show’s title is borrowed fromLet Us Now Praise Famous Men, James Agee and Walker Evans’s collaborative depression-era masterpiece published in 1941.

2022,Alter Egos | Projected Selves,"November 22, 2021–May 1, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/alter-egos-projected-selves,"Aliases, avatars, and alter egos abound in today’s media, from pseudonyms and selfies on social platforms to packaged personae in pop culture. What’s more, in a society shaped by a global pandemic, we all have become accustomed to projecting virtual versions of ourselves, experiencing the perks and pitfalls of routinely enacting “self-portraits.” Artists, of course, have long employed themselves as the subjects of their work, a convention that is especially rich within the history of photography. The camera, when turned on oneself, seems singularly equipped to expose multiple interior lives, whether real or imagined. The photograph, as the product of this interaction, facilitates the realization of different selves and diverse ways of being in the world. Drawn primarily from The Met collection, the works in this exhibition demonstrate how, especially in recent decades, many artists have deployed themselves as photographic subjects in order to experiment with identity, invent or disrupt narratives, and intervene in the medium of photography itself. Before and behind the camera, they toy with the expectations of self-portraiture. Posing in costume, photographers from Nadar to Nikki S. Lee appropriate imagined identities. Tom Friedman and Ellen Carey manipulate their images beyond recognition, and Qualeasha Wood, in a bold affirmation of digital imagery, weaves her online avatars into a glitchy composite. Still others take the “self” out of self-portraiture entirely. Together, they explore the allure of this ubiquitous genre and alert us to its instability. The exhibition is made possible by Joyce Frank Menschel."

For the first time since its inauguration at The Met Cloisters in 1961, the Fuentidueña Chapel gallery, which typically focuses on the Christian tradition, will present a group of works that testify to the diversity of Spanish medieval art. By telling a more nuanced story in this space, the exhibition will demonstrate the ease with which objects and artistic ideas transcended differences of belief. Placed in dialogue with each other, the silk textiles, ivory carvings, illuminated manuscripts, frescoes, and monumental sculptures featured in the show will reveal a dynamic, interconnected past that often mirrors the present.The exhibition’s chronology, 1000 to 1200, corresponds to a pivotal era in the history of the Spanish Middle Ages—one that saw significant shifts in the balance of power between Christian and Muslim rulers, destabilizing long-standing social relationships and introducing new tensions among religious communities. Yet the visual arts make it clear that this was not a purely divisive age. In exploring how artists and patrons of the day drew from many sources of inspiration, negotiating the visual traditions of different religions,Spain, 1000–1200: Art at the Frontiers of Faithwill showcase the richness and complexity of interfaith interaction. In so doing, the exhibition draws upon the concept of the frontier—a boundary that simultaneously separates and connects—as a metaphor for Spain as a place of artistic creation.This exhibition will be accompanied by the Fall 2021 MetBulletin.#MetMedieval The exhibition andBulletinare made possible by the Michel David-Weill Fund.Additional support for theBulletinis provided by Tom and Diahn McGrath.The Met’s quarterlyBulletinprogram is supported in part by the Lila Acheson Wallace Fund for The Metropolitan Museum of Art, established by the cofounder ofReader’s Digest."

Early in her career she met reluctance placing her designs with publishers, as the field of book cover design was dominated by men. To surmount this challenge, she signed her early submissions “M.N. Armstrong.” However, the years 1892–93 were groundbreaking for women book cover designers: several important exhibitions in prominent clubs and at the World’s Columbian Exposition featured women designers and paved the way for the success they enjoyed during the next decades. As Armstrong’s career as a book designer progressed, her designs became more fluid and individualized, reflecting the book’s subject. With her increasingly colorful, striking book covers, she was in demand as a designer and worked for twenty-one different publishers producing approximately 270 book cover designs. Spring Blossoms: Margaret Armstrong’s Decorated Publishers’ Bindings, Watson Library’s first online exhibition, presents a selection of books with covers designed by Armstrong from the 1890s to 1913. The exhibit highlights four themes: designs that invoke the patterns of stained glass, the lavender series of publications by Myrtle Reed, designs featuring flowers and plant forms, and lesser-known book covers.

2022,Surrealism Beyond Borders,"October 11, 2021–January 30, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/surrealism-beyond-borders," A telephone receiver that morphs into a lobster. A miniature train that rushes from a fireplace. These are just a few of the familiar images associated with Surrealism, a revolutionary idea sparked in Paris around 1924 that asserted the unconscious and dreams over the familiar and every day. While Surrealism could generate often poetic and even humorous works, it was also taken up as a far more serious weapon in the struggle for political, social, and personal freedom, and by many more artists around the world. Nearly from its inception, Surrealism has had an international scope, but knowledge of the movement has been formed primarily through a Western European focus. This exhibition reconsiders the true “movement” of Surrealism across boundaries of geography and chronology—and within networks that span Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, Asia to North Africa, and Australia to Latin America. Including almost eight decades of work produced across 45 countries,Surrealism Beyond Bordersoffers a fresh appraisal of these collective concerns and exchanges—as well as historical, national, and local distinctions—that will recast appreciation of this most revolutionary and globe-spanning movement. #SurrealismBeyond To access the booklet of all in-gallery labels, clickhere.

2022,Relative Values: The Cost of Art in the Northern Renaissance,"August 7, 2017–January 23, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/relative-values-northern-renaissance,"Bringing together sixty-two masterpieces of sixteenth-century northern European art from The Met collection and one important loan, this exhibition revolves around questions of historical worth, exploring relative value systems in the Renaissance era. Organized in six sections—raw materials, virtuosity, technological advances, fame, market, and paragone—tapestry, stained and vessel glass, sculpture, paintings, precious metal-work, and enamels are juxtaposed with pricing data from sixteenth-century documents. What did a tapestry cost in the sixteenth century? Goldsmiths' work? Stained glass? How did variables like raw materials, work hours, levels of expertise and artistry, geography, and rarity, affect this? Did production cost necessarily align with perceived market valuation in inventoried collections? Who assigned these values? By exploring different sixteenth-century yardsticks of gauging worth, by probing extrinsic versus intrinsic value, and by presenting works of different media and function side-by-side, the exhibition captures a sense of the splendor and excitement of this era.

2022,Celebrating the Year of the Ox,"January 30, 2021–January 17, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/year-of-the-ox,"The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating 12–year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century B.C. and became firmly established by the first century A.D. The 12 animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of the people born in that year. This Lunar New Year, which begins on February 12, 2021, is the Year of the Ox. In celebration of the Year of the Ox, this exhibition presents depictions of oxen and water buffalo (considered the same category of animals in China) created by artists in the last 3,000 years. Particularly notable are a massive eighteenth-century jade sculpture of a water buffalo and a remarkable eighth-century set of ceramic Chinese zodiac figures, illustrating the important role that the animals play in the life of humans.

Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to one hundred objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject.For centuries, art has played a role in revolutions, protests, and social activist movements. This installation explores how artists from the eighteenth century to the present have mobilized works on paper to promote causes or ideals, record or respond to events, and sway public opinion. The drawings, prints, and posters on view relate to the American, French, Haitian, Mexican, and Russian revolutions, the abolition of slavery, and campaigns for and against the dominant political systems of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As this grouping demonstrates, artists have turned to printmaking, in particular, to call attention to racial, gender, and economic injustices.  A selection of prints investigate the role art has played in revolutions, protests, and social activist movements from the eighteenth century to the present. Read more on Perspectives."
2022,"Modern Times: British Prints, 1913–1939","November 1, 2021–January 9, 2022",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/modern-times,"During the tumultuous years between 1913 and 1939, numerous British artists and expatriates linked to Vorticism, Futurism, and the Grosvenor School of Modern Art turned to printmaking to convey the vibrancy and innovation, as well as the destruction and turmoil, of contemporary life.Modern Times: British Prints, 1913–1939will feature more than 100 outstanding and rare works on paper made during this period. Their subjects—which included factories and underground trains, war-torn landscapes and “dazzle ships,” leisure activities, and the countryside as both idealized rural landscape and one transformed by urban expansion—reveal an interest in speed, motion, labor, industrialization, technology, and modernity broadly considered. In addition to traditional printmaking methods, artists embraced new techniques, such as the color linocut, which represented the artists’ democratic aspirations for both art making and collecting.The exhibition will celebrate the transformative acquisition of British modernist works on paper from the collection of Leslie and Johanna Garfield, the most significant collection of its kind. Featured artists include Sybil Andrews, Claude Flight, Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson, Cyril Power, and Edward Wadsworth, as well as international artists who worked or studied in Britain, such as Edward McKnight Kauffer and Lill Tschudi. Visitors will gain a greater and more comprehensive understanding of the artists’ oeuvres, printmaking, and British modernism as a whole in the years bracketed by two world wars.#BritishPrints  Take a closer look at objects from the exhibitionModern Times: British Prints, 1913–1939with curator of Drawings and Prints, Jennifer Farrell."

But in 1974, Senegalese scholar and humanist Cheikh Anta Diop shocked and challenged historians by asserting the influence of ancient African civilizations in his groundbreaking bookThe African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality. This exhibition pays homage to Diop by presenting masterpieces from the Museum’s collections from west and central Africa alongside art from ancient Egypt for the first time in The Met’s history. Through twenty-one pairings of works from different African cultures and eras, this exhibition provides a rare opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary creativity of the continent across five millennia, revealing unexpected parallels and contrasts. Although there was no contact between their creators, the works share deep and underrecognized histories. The African Origin of Civilizationwill remain on view while The Met’s galleries of Sub-Saharan African Art are closed for thecomplete renovationof the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing. The re-envisioned wing is expected to reopen in 2024, and will feature three distinct suites of galleries for Sub-Saharan African Art, Ancient American Art, and Oceanic Art.

2023,Don't Forget to Call Your Mother,"December 18, 2023–September 15, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/don-t-forget-to-call-your-mother,"At a time when photographs are primarily shared and saved digitally, many artists are returning to the physicality of snapshots in an album or pictures in an archive as a source of inspiration. Drawing its title,Don’t Forget to Call Your Mother, from a photograph by Italian provocateur Maurizio Cattelan, the exhibition consists of works in The Met collection from the 1970s to today that reflect upon the complicated feelings of nostalgia and sentimentality that these objects conjure, while underlining the power of the found object. Among the featured artists is Sadie Barnette, for whom photographs provide a portal to illuminate the forgotten history of the first Black-owned gay bar in San Francisco and her own father’s life as her 2022 workPhoto Barpowerfully illustrates. Like Barnette, many of the artists in the exhibition seek to fortify the legacy of family histories, to emphasize the importance of intergenerational relationships, and to consider the ways in which knowledge and respect for the past can inform our current moment. Some artists such as Sophie Calle and Larry Sultan explore their own narratives to reveal the construction of desire, while others including Taryn Simon and Hank Willis Thomas examine histories that have shaped cultural and political dialogue. For some, including Darrel Ellis who utilized family pictures to negotiate the trauma of police violence, the personal is political. Deploying various strategies, these artists consider how a collection of images—like a talisman or an altarpiece—build relationships across time and can transform our understanding of the present.  The exhibition is made possible by Joyce Frank Menschel."

The exhibition begins with sacred images from early Japan that speak to concerns about death, dying, and the afterlife or that were created in response to other uncertainties, such as war and natural disaster. The presentation then proceeds chronologically, highlighting medieval Buddhist images of paradises and hells, Zen responses to life and death, depictions of war and pilgrimage, and the role of protective and hopeful images in everyday life. In the final galleries, the exhibition’s underlying themes are explored through a selection of modern woodblock prints, garments, and photographs.

2023,Bélizaire and the Frey Children,"October 12, 2023–July 1, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/belizaire-and-the-frey-children,"Bélizaire and the Frey Childrenis a rare American portrait of an enslaved Black subject depicted with the family of his enslaver. Attributed to the leading French émigré portraitist working in 1830s–50s New Orleans, the painting illuminates the complex relationships of intimacy and inhumanity that defined domestic enslavement. The portrait’s later history also reveals the consequential afterlives of slavery. At the turn of the twentieth century, the prominent depiction of the enslaved Afro-Creole teenager, Bélizaire (ca. 1822–after 1860), who is positioned against a Louisiana landscape above the three young Frey siblings presumably in his care, was deliberately concealed—likely by a member of the Frey family. His figure was only revealed after a careful conservation treatment. Archival research has also recovered the identities and some of the histories of all four subjects. Bélizaire survived the Civil War and lived to experience freedom. Both Frey sisters died the same year the portrait was painted, their brother some nine years later."

Born in Iran in 1971, Nairy Baghramian fled to Berlin, Germany, in 1984, where she continues to live and work. Baghramian creates abstract sculptures that explore the dynamics of the body, gender, and dichotomies of private and public space. Her site-responsive sculptures and installations engage with architecture and often evoke bodily gestures, junctures, or fragments. Along with site responsivity, other hallmarks of Baghramian’s work are polychromy and the innovative and subversive use of different types of material. The exhibition is made possible by the Jane and Robert Carroll Fund, the Director’s Fund, Angela A. Chao and Jim Breyer, Robert Denning, Cynthia Hazen Polsky and Leon B.

Landscape is a focus here, with the genre becoming closely allied to the growing popularity of watercolor during this period. Around 1760, artists like Paul and Thomas Sandby, Francis Towne, and Thomas Jones began to explore the medium’s expressive potential. In the nineteenth century, dedicated watercolor societies were established and held regular exhibitions to promote their members’ work. Increasingly developed and poetically resonant compositions sought to challenge the preeminence of oil painting.  In this display, watercolors made rapidly out of doors by John Constable and Peter De Wint may be compared to finished compositions by John Brett, Samuel Palmer, and Alfred William Hunt. Travel’s ability to spur creativity is demonstrated by works that respond to sites in Britain, France, Italy, Caucasia, and North Africa. Nature studies, conversely, affirm how foreign flora became increasingly available at home. Finally, the sustained importance of the figure is represented by early chalk and pastel renderings by Joseph Wright of Derby and Allan Ramsay, vibrantly colored later portraits by David Wilkie and John Frederick Lewis, and representations of Black models by Lewis, William Henry Hunt, and Simeon Solomon."

This exhibition examines the emergence of distinctly middle-class taste in late medieval England by showcasing a rare set of large-scale domestic sculptures from Exeter. Commissioned by a merchant named Henry Hamlyn, the sculptures, which adorned the exterior of his house, feature stock characters drawn from popular prints and bawdy tales: a jester, a quarreling couple, peasants, and musicians. Rustic in style and subject matter, they fascinatingly came across as figures both amusing and menacing. With over fifty works, including textiles, prints, furnishings, and other decorative arts,Rich Man, Poor Manexplores why Hamlyn might have been drawn to such imagery. It also highlights how the home, both inside and out, could serve as a form of individual self-expression and a statement of social order.

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum’s curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate in large batches his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards—along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters—to The Met. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. This exhibition features nearly one hundred cards produced between 1887 and 1959. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era, at the turn of the nineteenth century, through the golden age and modern era of the sport.

2023,"Vertigo of Color: Matisse, Derain, and the Origins of Fauvism","October 13, 2023–January 21, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/vertigo-of-color,"Over an intense nine weeks in the summer of 1905 in the modest fishing village of Collioure on the French Mediterranean, Henri Matisse and Andre Derain embarked on a partnership that led to a wholly new, radical artistic language later known as Fauvism. Their daring, energetic experiments with color, form, structure, and perspective changed the course of French painting; it marked an introduction to early modernism and introduced Matisse’s first important body of work in his long career. This exhibition, which is co-organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, emphasizes as never before the legacy of that summer and examines the paintings, drawings, and watercolors of Matisse and Derain through sixty-five works on loan from national and international museums, including Musée National d’Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou; National Galleries of Scotland; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and the Museum of Modern Art, New York; as well as private collections. With this new direction in painting, Matisse and Derain manipulated color in radical ways—nature took on hues responding to the artists’ sensations rather than reality. At the Salon d’Automne in 1905, when Matisse and Derain unveiled their controversial canvases, a prominent French journalist labeled them “les Fauves,” or wild beasts. Accompanied by a catalogue. The exhibition is made possible by The Florence Gould Foundation. Additional support is provided by an Anonymous Foundation.

2023,Proof: Maxime Du Camp’s Photographs of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa,"October 23, 2023–January 21, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/proof-maxime-du-camp,"In October 1849, twenty-seven-year-old Maxime Du Camp—an aspiring journalist with big ambitions—left Paris to photograph sites across the eastern Mediterranean. Officially encouraged to exploit photography’s “uncontestable exactitude,” he returned to France a year and a half later with more than 200 paper negatives, from which 125 were selected to illustrateEgypte, Nubie, Palestine et Syrie(1852). This work, the first photographically illustrated book published in France, arguably established an aesthetic standard for documentary photography: its salted paper prints are rendered in cool, gradated tones that one contemporary critic described as “vaporous gray.” The published photographs stand in stark contrast to several sets (each unique) that Du Camp privately printed before planning his book. These “proof prints” are noteworthy for their surprising range of warm colors, handwork, and a luminescence that recalls their Mediterranean origin. Unlike the book’s focus on monuments and ancient ruins, they also provide evidence of modern civilization in unfamiliar, arid landscapes.Proofis the first exhibition to focus on The Met’s collection of these earlier prints, including previously unseen and unpublished views from a portfolio and a small, handbound album. Offering an exceptional opportunity to compare these photographs to those published in 1852, the exhibition reveals that Du Camp’s ultimate project did not present objective proof of its Mediterranean subject, but rather a complicated view shaped by personal ambition, emergent technology, and the taste and temperament of its nineteenth-century European audience.

2023,Picasso: A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn,"September 14, 2023–January 14, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/picasso-cubist-commission,"In 1910 Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) embarked on a decorative commission for the Brooklyn residence of artist, collector, and critic Hamilton Easter Field (1873–1922), whom he had met in Paris the year before. The artist’s brief called for as many as eleven panels to line the walls of Field’s home library and form an enveloping aesthetic whole. The proposed room offered Picasso his first opportunity to move beyond easel painting and apply his radical Cubist style to decorative painting formats of challenging size and proportion. Working from his studio in France, the artist completed a group of figure and still life compositions, but the commission was never realized. The exhibition is the first to present this little-known chapter of Picasso’s Cubist period and provides an occasion to consider Cubism in relation to decorative painting conventions and architectural space. It brings together six extant canvas panels and related works, as well as archival material on Field, Picasso, and the site of the commission. Accompanied by a catalogue.

Before your visit, please consult library hourshere. Featuring more than twenty five publications reproducing art created in the concentration camps and soon after liberation,Artists of the Holocausttestifies to the atrocities, the artists’ indomitable will to document their experiences, and the power of publications to educate and inform. The exhibition consists of postwar portfolios from the 1940s; personal illustrated narratives from the 1940s through the 1970s; exhibition catalogs; books featuring children’s art created in Theresienstadt; and Tana Kellner’s powerful artists’ book,71125,Fifty Years of Silence: Eva Kellner’s Story(1992). The exhibition additionally presents work by Holocaust survivors Leo Haas (1901–1983), Esther Lurie (1913– 1998), and Simon Wiesenthal (1908–2005), among others. Watson Library has actively developed our collection on artists of the Holocaust for the past fifteen years. A landmark 1978 exhibition catalog published by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations,Spiritual Resistance: Art from Concentration Camps, 1940–1945: a Selection of Drawings and Paintings from the Collection of Kibbutz Lohamei Haghetaot, Israel,served as the foundational guide to enhancing our collection. The list of artists exhibited provided an initial checklist to develop the library’s holdings in this area. Tom Freudenheim, former director of the Baltimore Museum of Art, which was one of the venues, contributed an essay to the catalog, “Art from Concentration Camps” that set an example on how to approach this material. In 2020, the library received an important donation on Judaica and Jewish history from Freudenheim, including numerous publications on art from concentration camps."
2023,"The Great Hall Commission: Jacolby Satterwhite,A Metta Prayer","October 2, 2023–January 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/jacolby-satterwhite,"For the second in a series of commissions for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Great Hall, interdisciplinary artist Jacolby Satterwhite (born Columbia, South Carolina, 1986) has transformed the historic space with a site-specific multimedia installation. TitledA Metta Prayer, the project fuses choreography, video, animation, lighting, and music to imagine a kaleidoscopic, computer-generated world within The Met’s Great Hall. The installation features live performances on select dates by the artist’s collaborators including Hairbone (Raul de Nieves with Jessie Stead), Ioanna Gika, KelseyLu, Kindness, Lafawndah with Nightfeelings, Patrick Belaga, serpentwithfeet, and Ahya Simone. Satterwhite’s ambitious installation at The Met is the result of a highly technical creative practice involving a myriad of software platforms and emergent technologies. Projected onto the walls of the Great Hall, the six-channel video features more than 70 animated objects from The Met collection that populate an imagined digital architecture. Live action sequences captured in three dimensions feature collaborators—including Solange, KelseyLu, and Moses Sumney and drag performers like queer wrestling group Choke Hole—as characters within his narrative. Satterwhite animates these elements together with computer-generated imagery, applying the logic of video games to his unique virtual world. At a time when Black and LGBTQ+ communities face continued threats of violence, A Metta Prayer constructs a digital space that expresses love, joy, and resilience. Satterwhite draws inspiration from the Buddhist Metta prayer, a mantra of loving-kindness, to build a narrative that rebels against the conventions of commercial video games. Rather than perpetuating violence, the characters in A Metta Prayer dance, perform, preach, and pose. Scenes inspired by endless runner platform games, in which players move forward, gain points, and avoid obstacles, show characters collecting mantra “coins” to achieve enlightenment. Encounters with police result in dance flash mobs. Heroines ascend from a dystopian city to a cloud-filled sky teeming with life. Throughout the 21-minute video cycle, Satterwhite deploys mindful repetition as a formal principle, linking the video’s rhythm to the recurrent nature of the Metta mantra. A soundtrack produced by PAT (Jacolby Satterwhite, Patricia Satterwhite, Nightfeelings, and Patrick Belaga) pulses with energy, providing the video with its driving beat. The commission is made possible by Cynthia Hazen Polsky and Leon B. Polsky, and The Director’s Fund. Additional support is provided by Sarah Arison, the Adrienne Arsht Fund for Resilience through Art, the Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman Fund, Peter Steinberg and Kathrine Gehring, and Helen Lee Warren and David Warren.

2023,The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Met,"May 24, 2021–January 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/good-life-collecting-late-antique-art,"The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Metshowcases the Museum’s important and rare collection of third- to eighth-century art from Egypt and reevaluates it through the lens of late antique ideas about abundance, virtue, and shared classical taste. Writers and craftspeople translated these ideas into a concept celebrated as the “the good life.” Anchored by crucial gifts to The Met of late antique art, the exhibition explores themes connected to social status, wealth, and living well in Late Antiquity. The core of The Met’s collection from late antique Egypt was formed through public subscriptions and generous gifts in the 1890s. The first decades after the Museum’s founding was a time when profound interest in the earliest Christian art inspired scholars, collectors, and the public alike. Today, The Met continues to collect late antique art that reveals the burgeoning of literary and visual representations of a life well lived. This exhibition highlights The Met’s holdings of late antique textiles, decorative arts, jewelry, and sculpture—all highly prized by elite patrons of the Byzantine Empire’s southern provinces in Africa. The works of art featured in the exhibition reflect the extraordinary wealth of Mediterranean Africa. In addition to marking status, these objects responded to such fundamental questions as, What does it mean to “live well”? During the period, ideas about “the good life” intersected with issues of religion, identity, and relationships with the past. As a result, these objects not only testify to The Met’s long-standing interest in late antique art of the region but also shed light on some of the aspirations, values, and lifestyles of its upper classes. #MetByzantine The exhibition is made possible by The Giorgi Family Foundation."

Some painters learned at home, from fathers, mothers, or other relatives among whom painting was a shared language of familial communication. Others learned from friends who shared their passion. Still others turned to painting manuals, treatises that expanded knowledge of painting to anyone who could buy a woodblock-printed book.

The religious landscape of ancient India was transformed by the teachings of the Buddha, which in turn inspired art devoted to expressing his message. Sublime imagery adorned the most ancient monumental religious structures in ancient India, known as stupas.

In addition to their significance as social conventions, rituals often reaffirm state, governmental, and religious principles. In Korea, performing ancestral rites (jesa) is an enduring tradition that embodies respect for parents and the commemoration of ancestors, key tenets of Confucianism. During the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910), Neo-Confucianism was the ruling ideology. People engaged in rituals on the birth and death anniversaries for ancestors upward of five generations, and on major holidays, such as the Lunar New Year and Chuseok (Harvest Moon Festival). Court ancestral rites became the bedrock of Joseon political life and were enacted on a grand scale that included musical and dance performances. A key feature throughout was a table bearing food and drink offerings presented onjegi, or ritual objects. This exhibition features the various types of ritual vessels and accessories that were used for this purpose and entombed, as well as the kinds of musical instruments played at state events. Though the vessels’ shapes, sizes, and materials may differ, a persistent feature is elevation, either through a high foot or a pedestal.

2023,Richard Avedon: MURALS,"January 19–October 1, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/richard-avedon-murals,"In 1969, Richard Avedon was at a crossroads. After a five-year hiatus, the photographer started making portraits again, this time with a new camera and a new sense of scale. Trading his handheld Rolleiflex for a larger, tripod-mounted device, he reinvented his studio dynamic. Instead of dancing around his subjects from behind a viewfinder, as he had in his lively fashion pictures, he could now stand beside a stationary camera and meet them head-on. Facing down groups of the era’s preeminent artists, activists, and politicians, he made huge photomural portraits, befitting their outsized cultural influence. On the centennial of the photographer’s birth,Richard Avedon: MURALSwill bring together three of these monumental works, some as wide as 35 feet. For Avedon, the murals expanded the artistic possibilities of photography, radically reorienting viewers and subjects in a subsuming, larger-than-life view.The murals are society portraits. In them, Avedon assembles giants of the late twentieth century—members of Andy Warhol’s Factory, architects of the Vietnam war, and demonstrators against that war—who together shaped an extraordinarily turbulent era of American life. Presented in one gallery, their enormous portraits will stage an unlikely conversation among historically opposed camps, as well as contemporary viewers. The formal innovations of Avedon’s high style—of starkly lit bodies in an unsparing white surround—are best realized in these works, where subjects jostle and crowd the frame, and bright voids between them crackle with tension. Uniting the murals with session outtakes and contemporaneous projects, the exhibition will track Avedon’s evolving approach to group portraiture, through which he so transformed the conventions of the genre. The exhibition is made possible by Joyce Frank Menschel."
2023,In Praise of Painting: Dutch Masterpieces at The Met,"October 16, 2018–September 17, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/in-praise-of-painting-dutch-masterpieces,"Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century—the Golden Age of Rembrandt, Hals, and Vermeer—have been a highlight of The Met collection since the Museum's founding purchase in 1871. This exhibition brings together some of the Museum's greatest paintings to present this remarkable chapter of art history in a new light. Through sixty-seven works of art organized thematically,In Praise of Paintingorients visitors to key issues in seventeenth-century Dutch culture—from debates about religion and conspicuous consumption to painters' fascination with the domestic lives of women. The exhibition provides a fresh perspective on the canon and parameters of the Dutch Golden Age by uniting paintings from Benjamin Altman's bequest, the Robert Lehman Collection, and the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection. Works typically displayed separately in the Museum's galleries—such as Rembrandt'sGerard de Lairesseand Lairesse's ownApollo and Aurora—are presented side by side, producing a visually compelling narrative about the tensions between realism and idealism during this period. The presentation also provides the opportunity to conserve and display rarely exhibited paintings, including Margareta Haverman'sA Vase of Flowers—one of only two known paintings by the artist and the only painting by an early modern Dutch woman currently in The Met collection. The exhibition takes its title from one of the period's major works of art theory, Philips Angel'sThe Praise of Painting(1642), a pioneering defense of realism in art.

2023,Light and Tone: Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints,"May 18–September 5, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/light-and-tone,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to 100 objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. The current installation explores the pursuit of tonal gradation and contrast in works varying from the completely monochrome to the brightly colored. A selection of drawings on prepared and dyed papers, ranging from Renaissance masterworks by Wolf Huber and Peter Candid to dazzling sheets by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century artists like Angelica Kauffman and Alphonse Legros, demonstrates the versatility of colored grounds for studies and for finished compositions. A nearby display examines the role of color in hand-painted woodcuts and engravings. The works on view, which include some of the earliest examples of the practice, represent wide-ranging approaches to the relationship of watercolor and printed image. Another section of the installation traces the evolution of a mezzotint: five states, or stages, of one print from John Constable and David Lucas’sEnglish Landscapeseries demonstrates how the image gradually took shape as the printing plate was worked and refined. Yet another group of prints considers how the techniques of woodcut and wood engraving lend themselves to depictions of oceans and other bodies of water. Works by Edvard Munch, Vija Celmins, Denis Stéen, Josef Albers, and others show how jagged fibers of wood can be transformed into the illusion of flowing waves, currents, and the light-reflective surface of water. Meanwhile, landscape drawings by nineteenth-century French artists Jean-François Millet, Théodore Rousseau, Charles-François Daubigny, and Adolphe Appian show how black chalk, charcoal, and conté crayon can be manipulated to achieve subtle tonal gradations and compelling effects of light. The installation also includes a suite of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century designs for stained glass windows, including three Tiffany and Company drawings from The Met’s American Wing. Representing various stages of the design process, from exploratory sketches to cartoons (full-scale model drawings), these works reveal how designers anticipated the eventual translation of their drawings into translucent glass. A final section features vivid images of ships by twentieth- and twenty-first-century artists H. C. Westermann, Philip Orenstein, and Richard Bosman. Whether meditating on World War II history or depicting death at sea, these prints take full advantage of the expressive power of color."
2023,"Berenice Abbott’s New York Album, 1929","March 2–September 4, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/berenice-abbott,"In January 1929, after eight years in Europe, the American photographer Berenice Abbott (1898–1991) boarded an ocean liner to New York City for what was meant to be a short visit. Upon arrival, she found the city transformed and ripe with photographic potential. “When I saw New York again, and stood in the dirty slush, I felt that here was the thing I had been wanting to do all my life,” she recalled. With a handheld camera, Abbott traversed the city, photographing its skyscrapers, bridges, elevated trains, and neighborhood street life. She pasted these “tiny photographic notes” into a standard black-page album, arranging them by subject and locale. Consisting of 266 small black-and-white prints arranged on thirty-two pages, Abbott’s New York album marks a key turning point in her career—from her portrait work in Paris to the urban documentation that culminated in her federally funded project,Changing New York(1935–39).Berenice Abbott’s New York Album, 1929presents a selection of unbound pages from this unique album, shedding new light on the creative process of one of the great photographic artists of the twentieth century. For context, the exhibition also features views of Paris by Eugène Atget (French, 1857–1927), whose extensive photographic archive Abbott purchased and publicized; views of New York City by her contemporaries Walker Evans, Paul Grotz, and Margaret Bourke-White; and photographs fromChanging New York.

2023,Van Gogh's Cypresses,"May 22–August 27, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/van-gogh-cypresses,"Van Gogh’s Cypressesis the first exhibition to focus on the trees—among the most famous in the history of art—immortalized in signature images by Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890). Such iconic pictures asWheat Field with CypressesandThe Starry Nighttake their place as the centerpiece in a presentation that affords an unprecedented perspective on a motif virtually synonymous with the Dutch artist’s fiercely original power of expression. Some 40 works illuminate the extent of his fascination with the region’s distinctive flamelike evergreens as they successively sparked, fueled, and stoked his imagination over the course of two years in the South of France: from his initial sightings of the “tall and dark” trees in Arles to realizing their full, evocative potential (“as I see them”) at the asylum in Saint-Rémy.Juxtaposing landmark paintings with precious drawings and illustrated letters—many rarely, if ever, lent or exhibited together—this tightly conceived thematic exhibition offers an extraordinary opportunity to appreciate anew some of Van Gogh’s most celebrated works in a context that reveals the backstory of their invention for the first time.Accompanied by a catalogue. The exhibition is made possible by the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Foundation. Additional support is provided by the Janice H. Levin Fund, Katharine Rayner, and the Aaron I.

2023,Philip Guston: What Kind of Man Am I?,"May 25–August 1, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/philip-guston,"Philip Guston (1913–1980) was born in Montreal to immigrants who had fled the persecution of Jews in Odessa, in present-day Ukraine, a decade earlier. Raised in Los Angeles, he worked in the Midwest for part of the 1940s and settled permanently in New York in 1949, dividing his time between Manhattan and his studio in Woodstock. Although Guston is often associated with Abstract Expressionism, his career is too expansive to be understood solely in relationship to that movement. By the late 1960s, he was forging a singular path.This installation, which features eight works created during the last eleven years of Guston’s life, celebrates anextraordinary promised giftof two hundred and twenty paintings and drawings from the artist’s daughter Musa Guston Mayer. Thanks to Mayer’s generosity, The Met will become the largest repository of Guston’s work and the future center for its study.Guston consistently interrogated his purpose and identity as an artist, giving rise to a self-reflexive body of work that embraces both abstract and representational content. He grappled openly with symbols of evil and prejudice and explored the experience of mortality and vulnerability, especially in the late work seen here. Guston’s art engages unflinchingly with some of the most distressing aspects of human nature. At the same time, there is great pleasure to be had in his paintings, whose colors, brushwork, and materiality indulge close looking. Contradictions such as these go to the heart of Guston’s practice, endowing it with aesthetic and philosophical urgency. #MetGuston  "

In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum’s curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate in large batches his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards—along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters—to The Met. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.This exhibition features over one hundred thirty cards produced between 1887 and 1953. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era, at the turn of the nineteenth century, through the golden age and modern era of the sport. Produced using various types of media—from photography to lithography—the cards feature legends of the game as well as lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."

2023,"Juan de Pareja, Afro-Hispanic Painter","April 3–July 16, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/juan-de-pareja,"This exhibition offers an unprecedented look at the life and artistic achievements of seventeenth-century Afro-Hispanic painter Juan de Pareja (ca. 1608–1670). Largely known today as the subject of The Met’siconic portraitby Diego Velázquez, Pareja—who was born in Antequera, Spain—was enslaved in Velázquez’s studio for over two decades before becoming an artist in his own right. This presentation is the first to tell his story and examine the ways in which enslaved artisanal labor and a multiracial society are inextricably linked with the art and material culture of Spain’s “Golden Age.” Representations of Spain’s Black and Morisco populations in works by Francisco de Zurbarán, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, and Velázquez join works that chart the ubiquity of enslaved labor across media, from sculpture to silver. The Met’s portrait, executed by Velázquez in Rome in 1650, is contextualized by his other portraits from this period and the original document whereby Pareja was freed upon return to Madrid. The exhibition culminates in the first gathering of Pareja’s rarely seen paintings, some of enormous scale, which engage with the canons of Western art while reverberating throughout the African diaspora. Harlem Renaissance collector and scholar Arturo Schomburg was vital to the recovery of Pareja’s work and serves as a thread connecting seventeenth-century Spain with twentieth-century New York, providing a lens through which to view the multiple histories that have been written about Pareja. Accompanied by a publication. The exhibition is made possible by the Sherman Fairchild Foundation. Major support is provided by Denise Sobel.

Borrowing the format of trophies—emblems of competition and victory—Hew Locke has created four sculptures that reflect on the exercise and representation of power. These works feature details inspired by objects in The Met collection, many rendered unfamiliar through appropriation, fragmentation, and recombination. Relying on an aesthetic of excess and artifice,Giltleverages the relationship between guilt and gold across 3,000 years of art history, exploring the routes objects travel over time as well as the material and symbolic values that accrues to them as they change hands. Hew Locke was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1959 and raised in Guyana, a multiracial, multicultural nation in South America that was formed in the crucible of indigeneity, European colonialism, the African slave trade, and Indian indentureship. He and his family arrived in Guyana in 1966, just as the country was establishing its independence from British rule. Locke returned to the United Kingdom in 1980, travelling alongside a wave of immigrants from Britain’s current and former colonies in the Caribbean. He completed a BA in Fine Art at Falmouth School of Art in 1988 and an MA in Sculpture at the Royal College of Art in 1994. He has resided full time in London since 1989.

2023,Innocence and Experience: Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints,"February 9–May 16, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/innocence-experience,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to 100 objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. This installation considers how artists working in early Renaissance Italy, late Georgian Britain, and nineteenth-century Europe and America sought new approaches to record and shape visual imagery. Sections also focus on representations of motherhood and on portraiture. Early Italian drawings, ranging from model book sheets to sketches after nature, give insight into the emerging centrality of the medium to the artistic process. The selection illuminates popular workshop practices and explores the ways in which painters and sculptors relied on the exercise of drawing to record designs, develop compositions, and hone their craft. William Blake offered late Georgian Britons a radical new vision, revealed here through a treasured copy of his Songs of Innocence and Experience, acquired soon after the Print Department was established. These small, vibrant images are placed in conversation with Blake’s large relief etchings and Biblical watercolors, and works by his British contemporaries. Prints and drawings by nineteenth-century European, British, and American artists convey the intimate relationship of mother and child. From formal portraits to scenes of the private sphere, these works communicate the tenderness and tribulations of early motherhood. Finally, a group of etched portraits brings together artists, especially printmakers, in the circle of Edouard Manet and Edgar Degas."

It is a gift.” — Karli Frigge,The Magic of Marbling(2020) Karli Frigge’s quote embodies the humility of so many master paper artists who, after years of learning and experimentation, have created works of awe-inspiring technical achievement and aesthetic beauty. Since its early days in the late nineteenth century, The Met’s research library has acquired books and catalogs on the history of papermaking and decoration. Subjects include the history of American, European, Chinese, Japanese, and Southeast Asian paper; marbling from the Islamic world; and studies of other writing media such as papyrus and parchment. In the past twenty years, Watson’s collection of paper arts has been enhanced by hundreds of gifts and purchases funded by the Friends of Thomas J. Watson Library. In 2016, the Library received a substantial gift from Mary C. Schlosser, a past president of the Guild of Book Workers and Grolier Club member. A rich and varied collection, the Schlosser gift consists of 450 monographs, exhibition and trade catalogs, and periodicals on the arts of bookbinding, decorated paper, and papermaking. These include: important Bird & Bull Press titles; instructional guides; artists' books; the complete series ofHand Papermaking;andHandmade Papers of the World(Tokyo, 1979).

Yet, this sociopolitical and economic tumult also gave rise to a vibrant cultural and philosophical environment for nineteenth-century Danish artists.Beyond the Lightplaces the drawings, oil sketches, and paintings created by these artists firmly in this period, one that witnessed the transformation of a once-powerful Denmark into a small, somewhat marginalized country at the edge of Europe. Danish artists forged a close-knit community during this time, and the artworks they created explore notions of place, identity and belonging, and what it means to travel and return home.The exhibition features approximately 100 works from The Met collection, SMK – The National Gallery of Denmark, and several American collections, and highlights such artists as Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, Christen Købke, Constantin Hansen, Martinus Rørbye, and Vilhelm Hammershøi as well as lesser-known figures like Anton Melbye, Johan Thomas Lundbye, Peter Christian Skovgaard, and Heinrich Gustav Ferdinand Holm, among others.

The gods could die, and some were born anew, serving as models of regeneration and resilience. InLives of the Gods: Divinity in Maya Art, rarely seen masterpieces and recent discoveries trace the life cycle of the gods, from the moment of their creation in a sacred mountain to their dazzling transformations as blossoming flowers or fearsome creatures of the night. Maya artists, who lived in what is now Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, depicted the gods in imaginative ways from the monumental to the miniature—from exquisitely carved, towering sculptures to jade, shell, and obsidian ornaments that adorned kings and queens, connecting them symbolically to supernatural forces. Finely painted ceramics reveal the eventful lives of the gods in rich detail. Created by master artists of the royal cities of the Classic period (A.D. 250–900) Maya, the nearly 100 landmark works inLives of the Godsevoke a world in which the divine, human, and natural realms are interconnected and alive.

2023,Water Memories,"June 23, 2022–April 2, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/water-memories,"Water is the most intimate of all natural resources. We depend on and share our lives with water in its many forms—the soothing trickle of freshwater springs, meandering rivers, the rhythmic waves of a northern Great Lake, the thunderous roar of the ocean, and even debilitating droughts. Water reflects our emotions, awakens the senses, and excites imagination. Across the world, water conservation is a timely and urgent subject. This exhibition explores water’s significance to Indigenous peoples and Nations in the United States through historical, modern, and contemporary artworks. In four thematic sections—Ancestral Connections, Water and Sky, Forests and Streams, and Oceanic Imaginations—diverse aquatic expressions feature both representational and abstract approaches. The variety of items on view—protest fashion, hand-carved children’s toys, glass lamps, oil paintings, photographs, and video—create a current of memories belonging to Native American and non-Native artists. Throughout the exhibition, contemporary Indigenous community members provide individual interpretations and share their personal associations with water. The works collectively reveal how—across time and place—water provides nourishment, sanctuary, and healing while also activating protest, conflict, and complex dialogue.  Cannupa Hanska Luger (Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, Lakota, b. 1979)River (The Water Serpent) Oceti Sakowin, North Dakota, 2016 Cannupa Hanska Luger’s mirrored shield epitomizes the values of a Water Protector. Inspired by images of Ukrainian women holding up glass mirrors to riot police, the mirror shields were conceptualized using safe materials and first deployed at Standing Rock in November 2016 at the Oceti Sakowin Camp to stop Dakota Access Pipeline construction from crossing the Missouri River. Engaged here as a serpentine river of light, the shields are both art and defensive measure. Each shield protects against “nonlethal” police munitions—such as rubber bullets and truncheons—weaponized against Water Protectors. The reflective mirror is also defensive, aimed at showing police an image of themselves in hopes of reaching their humanity and making them less violent.

Exploring the practices and materials used in ancient polychromy, the exhibition highlights cutting-edge scientific methods used to identify ancient color and examines how color helped convey meaning in antiquity, and how ancient polychromy has been viewed and understood in later periods.The exhibition features a series of reconstructions of ancient sculptures in color by Prof. Dr. V. Brinkmann, Head of the Department of Antiquity at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung, and Dr. U. Koch-Brinkmann, and introduces a new reconstruction of The Met’s Archaic-period Sphinx finial, completed by The Liebieghaus team in collaboration with The Met.Presented alongside original Greek and Roman works representing similar subjects, the reconstructions are the result of a wide array of analytical techniques, including 3D imaging and rigorous art historical research. Polychromy is a significant area of study for The Met, and the Museum has a long history of investigating, preserving, and presenting manifestations of original color on ancient statuary. The exhibition is made possible by the Aretê Foundation/Betsy and Ed Cohen. Additional support is provided by Mary Jaharis and Cathrin M. Stickney and Mark P. Gorenberg.

While one gallery will highlight the creation of still life and genre painting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, two others will provide an overview of oil sketches from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, leading up to the Museum's unsurpassed collection of works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. A large gallery will display portraiture in the Grand Siècle, juxtaposing outstanding paintings by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck with Charles Le Brun’s monumental family portrait of the banker Everhard Jabach. The eighteenth-century French galleries will take up such themes as the study of expression, François Boucher and the decorative arts, and the role of female artists, who finally found a place in the academy. The Met’s unique collection of French Neoclassical painting, dominated by gifts fromJayne Wrightsman, will be installed with sculptured busts by Jean Antoine Houdon of the essential figures of the Enlightenment: Denis Diderot and Voltaire.

2023,Fictions of Emancipation: Carpeaux Recast,"March 10, 2022–March 5, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/carpeaux-recast,"Organized around a single object—the marble bustWhy Born Enslaved!by French sculptor Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux—Fictions of Emancipation: Carpeaux Recastis the first exhibition at The Met to examine Western sculpture in relation to the histories of transatlantic slavery, colonialism, and empire. Created in the wake of American emancipation and some twenty years after the abolition of slavery in the French Atlantic,Why Born Enslaved!was shaped by the enduring popularity of antislavery imagery, the development of nineteenth-century ethnographic theories of racial difference, and France’s colonialist fascination with Africa. The exhibition will explore the sculpture’s place within these contexts. Featuring more than thirty-five works of art in sections unfolding around Carpeaux’s sculpture,Fictions of Emancipationwill offer an in-depth look at portrayals of Black enslavement, emancipation, and personhood with an aim toward challenging the notion that representation in the wake of abolition constitutes a clear moral or political stance. Important works by Josiah Wedgwood, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, Charles Cordier, Edmonia Lewis, Louis-Simon Boizot, and others will show how Western artists of the nineteenth century engaged with the Black figure as a political symbol and site of exoticized beauty, while contemporary sculptures by Kara Walker and Kehinde Wiley will connect the dialogue around Carpeaux’s bust to current conversations about the legacies of slavery in the Western world. This exhibition was conceived in collaboration with guest curator Wendy S. Walters and enriched through conversations with numerous intellectual partners. It is one of many projects that the Museum is undertaking in an effort to reassess and broaden the narratives it presents about the past and present. Accompanied by a publication. The exhibition is made possible by the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Foundation. Additional support is provided by Allen R. Adler and Frances F. L. Beatty.

2023,Crossings,"October 27, 2022–February 28, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/crossings,"On view in the American Wing Gallery 767 through February 28, 2023 is a special display,Crossings, that explores ongoing resonances between past and present artistic expressions—specifically, modern and contemporary responses to Emanuel Leutze’s epicWashington Crossing the Delaware(1851). Evoking patriotic feelings in some viewers, conflict and struggle in others, this commanding icon—an unavoidable highlight of The Met’s American Wing—continues to spark debates about political ideas. In the more than century and a half since Leutze painted the canvas, several artists—especially those of color—have responded to the contrived subject, from Black AmericansJacob Lawrence, Robert Colescott, and Kara Walker to Indigenous (Cree)Kent Monkman. Each of their works confronts the biases of American history and mythmaking, while revealing the critical role art plays in shaping popular narratives. Colescott’s subversive take, painted in anticipation of the nation’s bicentennial, places the trailblazing scientist, inventor, and African American hero George Washington Carver at the helm of a boatload of Black stereotypes. The satire challenges viewers to accept the insidiousness of racism in popular culture as well as the urgency of truthful histories. Indebted to Colescott’s example, Walker’sThe Crossing(2017) interrogates U.S. power and patriotism in ways ever more relevant since the violent attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The diptych responds to two paintings at The Met that address the realities of a precarious ship of state, the Leutze and Winslow Homer’sThe Gulf Stream(1899, reworked by 1906). This intervention is the second part ofa contemporary codato The Met’s recent exhibitionWinslow Homer: Crosscurrents, now on view in reduced form at London’s National Gallery. While many of our Homers are on loan, others may be found in American Wing galleries 762 and 769."
2023,Kimono Style: The John C. Weber Collection,"June 7, 2022–February 20, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/kimono-style,"This exhibition will trace the transformation of the kimono from the late Edo period (1615–1868) through the early 20th century, as the T-shaped garment was adapted to suit the lifestyle of modern Japanese women. It will feature a remarkable selection of works from the renowned John C. Weber Collection of Japanese art that explore the mutual artistic exchanges between the kimono and Western fashion, as well as highlights from The Costume Institute’s collection. The weaving, dyeing, and embroidery techniques for which Japan is famed reached their peak of artistic sophistication during the Edo period. Members of the ruling military class were the primary consumers of sumptuous kimono, each one being custom-made. At the same time, a dynamic urban culture emerged, and the merchant class used its wealth to acquire material luxuries. Kimono, one of the most visible art forms, provided a way for the townspeople to proclaim their aesthetic sensibility. Depictions of kimono in Japanese woodblock prints were widely studied by Western couturiers in the late 19th century. The garment’s comparatively loose, enveloping silhouette, and its rectilinear cut would have the most profound and lasting influence on Western fashion, with couturiers like Madeleine Vionnet and Cristóbal Balenciaga taking inspiration from the kimono for their avant-garde creations. In the Meiji period (1868–1912), Western clothing was introduced to Japan. Simultaneously, modernization and social changes enabled more women to gain access to silk kimonos than ever before. Around the 1920s, affordable ready-to-wear kimono (meisen) became very popular and reflected a more Westernized lifestyle. These were sold in department stores modelled on Western retailers, following Western-style marketing strategies. To illustrate these connections, the exhibition will present over 60 kimonos alongside Western garments, paintings, prints, and decorative art objects. Accompanied by a catalogue. The exhibition is made possible by the Mary Livingston Griggs and Mary Griggs Burke Foundation Fund, 2015. The catalogue is made possible by the Florence and Herbert Irving Fund for Asian Art Publications. Additional support is provided by the Richard and Geneva Hofheimer Memorial Fund."
2023,The Power of Portraiture: Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints,"October 13, 2022–February 7, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-power-of-portraiture,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to 100 objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. Featuring a dazzling selection of prints and drawings ranging in date from the early seventeenth century to the present and including several new acquisitions, the current installation explores themes of artistic lineage and homage with a primary focus on portraiture. At its heart are works by members of Black Women of Print, a collective founded by Tanekeya Word to promote the visibility of Black women printmakers and create an equitable future within the discipline of printmaking. These dynamic images pay tribute to earlier Black women artists, among them Elizabeth Catlett and Emma Amos, whose works are also on view. Their prints, along with those by Lorna Simpson, Charles White, Fred Wilson, and John Wilson, reveal the expressive potential of portraiture. By depicting both anonymous sitters and well-known figures such as Malcolm X, Lena Horne, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., these artists call attention to the relationship of representation and power. Willie Cole’s monumental works further extend the boundaries of the genre, using steam irons and ironing boards to point to histories of unrecognized labor. Placed in dialogue with Cole’s prints are earlier images of European street vendors and of women engaged in domestic work, revealing the ample but ultimately partial vision of labor put forth by the Western pictorial tradition. Also featured in this rotation is a selection of woodland drawings by artists active in Central Europe between the late eighteenth century and the early twentieth. Together with depictions of narrative subjects set in the woods, these works demonstrate the appeal of the forest as a vehicle for the study of light and color and as a subject embedded with rich associations. Finally, a group of witchcraft scenes by Jacques de Gheyn II, Giovanni David, Francisco de Goya, Eugène Delacroix, and Odilon Redon trace the evolution of nightmare imagery—and the complicated societal values it reflects and perpetuates—across nearly three centuries."

2023,Noble Virtues: Nature as Symbol in Chinese Art,"September 10, 2022–January 29, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/noble-virtues,"Flowers, plants, and animals abound in Chinese art. From simple objects for the home to fancy vessels for the imperial court, popular prints to meticulously crafted paintings, manifestations of the natural world are found nearly everywhere. Sometimes these images are purely decorative, but often they carry meanings drawn from history, poetry, and cultural memory. Bamboo, for instance, which bends in the cold wind without breaking, can be a symbol of the virtuous person withstanding hard times; the plum blossom, which dares to bloom in the chill of early spring, an emblem of righteous bravery. For artists and viewers alike, associations such as these added layers of depth to an artwork. In this way, a vignette of the natural world could become a celebration of life, a wish for good fortune, or even a defiant act of protest. This exhibition, drawn primarily from The Met collection, introduces some of these themes through over 100 works of painting, calligraphy, and decorative arts. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
2023,Cubism and the Trompe l’Oeil Tradition,"October 20, 2022–January 22, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/cubism-trompe-loeil,"This exhibition will offer a radically new view of Cubism by demonstrating its engagement with the age-old tradition of trompe l’oeil painting. A self-referential art concerned with the nature of representation, trompe l’oeil (“deceive the eye”) beguiles the viewer with perceptual and psychological games that complicate definitions of truth and fiction. Many qualities seen as distinct to Cubism were, in fact, exploited by trompe l’oeil specialists over the centuries: the emphatically flat picture plane; the invasion of the “real” world into the pictorial one; the mimicry of materials; and the inclusion of new print media and advertising replete with coded references to artist, patron, and current events. In a contest of creative one-upmanship, the Cubists Georges Braque, Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso both parodied classic trompe l’oeil devices and invented new ways of confounding the viewer. Along with Cubist paintings, sculptures, and collages, the exhibition will present canonical examples of European and American trompe l’oeil painting from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries.

2023,Celebrating the Year of the Tiger,"January 29, 2022–January 17, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/year-of-the-tiger,"The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating twelve-year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac. The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century B.C. and became firmly established by the first century A.D. The twelve animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of people born in that year. February 1, 2022, marks the beginning of the Year of the Tiger, a creature characterized as brave, heroic, resolute, and vigorous. Tigers have been a prominent artistic subject since ancient times. Symbols of power and authority, they are often seen on the sacred ritual vessels of the Shang (ca. 1600–1046 B.C.) and Zhou (1046–256 B.C.) dynasties. During the late Zhou and Han (206 B.C.–A.D. 220) dynasties, rulers delegated military command to officers using tiger-shaped bronze tallies. Depictions of tigers permeate almost all aspects of Chinese culture. For example, the tiger symbolizes the western quadrant of the four cardinal directions. It is regarded as the king of all wild animals and used on military banners to illustrate bravery and swiftness. In Chinese folklore, the tiger is a protective deity able to dispel harmful spirits. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund.

2023,The Tudors: Art and Majesty in Renaissance England,"October 10, 2022–January 8, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/tudors,"England under the volatile Tudor dynasty was a thriving home for the arts. An international community of artists and merchants, many of them religious refugees, navigated the high-stakes demands of royal patrons, including England’s first two reigning queens. Against the backdrop of shifting political relationships with mainland Europe, Tudor artistic patronage legitimized, promoted, and stabilized a series of tumultuous reigns, from Henry VII’s seizure of the throne in 1485 to the death of his granddaughter Elizabeth I in 1603. The Tudor courts were truly cosmopolitan, boasting the work of Florentine sculptors, German painters, Flemish weavers, and Europe’s best armorers, goldsmiths, and printers, while also contributing to the emergence of a distinctly English style. This exhibition will trace the transformation of the arts in Tudor England through more than 100 objects—including iconic portraits, spectacular tapestries, manuscripts, sculpture, and armor—from both The Met collection and international lenders. Accompanied by a catalogue. To access the booklet of all in-gallery labels, clickhere. The exhibition is made possible by Alice Cary Brown and W.L.

Watson Library","September 22, 2022–January 3, 2023",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/past-present-future,"Past/Present/Futureis the culminating exhibition to Thomas J. Watson Library's grant project funded by theNational Endowment for the Humanities, which aimed to assess and expand the library's collection of underrepresented heritage groups, especially Indigenous American, Latinx, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander artists. While it is impossible to apply a single definition or category to all the acquired titles, many explore a suspension or intervention of temporality, bound together by shared themes of colonialism, land sovereignty, reclamation, and reconciliation. Thus, the titles selected here present artists whose work confronts the past, reconciles the present, and draws out new possibilities for the future of historically marginalized people in the United States. This selection also mirrors Watson Library's own endeavors to build a diverse body of perspectives and resources dedicated to the study of visual art by confronting what has been overlooked in the past, addressing it in our present moment, and mapping out a future where the collection better aligns with its values and purposes. The selected titles were gathered together through the joint effort of the project’s research associates and bibliographers Amanda Raquel Dorval, Anna Lee, and Louisa Raitt. Watson Library’s NEH Grant Project ran between October 2021 and December 2022, with catalogers Helice Koffler and Kim Ross; library associates Mia Ciallella, Raymond Lei, and Lo Traster-Lee; and led by Jared Ash, Florence and Herbert Irving Collections Librarian. This exhibition has been made possible in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities: Sustaining the Humanities through the American Rescue Plan, as part of an initiative to assess, expand, and promote access to the library’s collection of publications by and about Indigenous American, Latinx, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander artists.Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this exhibition do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities."
2024,Paris through the Eyes of Saint-Aubin,"September 26, 2024–February 4, 2025",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/paris-through-the-eyes-of-saint-aubin,"Gabriel de Saint-Aubin (1724–1780) was a prolific and unconventional draftsman whose drawings invite viewers into every corner of the French capital. As an observer and chronicler, he prowled the streets of Paris and recorded the full spectrum of daily life in his sketchbooks, from shop interiors to art auctions and public gardens to rowdy street fairs. Everything he saw was worthy of his attention, wit, and empathy. Saint-Aubin’s body of work is made up almost entirely of tiny, portable, and intricate works on paper. Taken together, these countless sketches give rise to a deeper view of the city as an organic form. Beyond capturing the tangible, they bring to light the pride and aspirations of Paris in the 18th century, a time when sites were being destroyed, rebuilt, and reimagined. Marking the 300th anniversary of his birth, the exhibition features a thematic arrangement demonstrating the breadth of Saint-Aubin’s interests. Examples of his drawings and prints, drawn from The Met’s holdings and local private collections, are complemented by a selection of works by his family and contemporaries, offering a context for his career and highlighting the unique nature of his vision."

In the decades leading up to the catastrophic onset of the plague around 1350, Siena was the site of phenomenal artistic innovation and activity. While Florence is often positioned as the center of the Renaissance, this presentation offers a fresh perspective on the importance of Siena, from Duccio’s profound influence on a new generation of painters to the development of narrative altarpieces and the dissemination of artistic styles beyond Italy. Drawing on the outstanding collections of The Met and the National Gallery, London, as well as rare loans from dozens of other major lenders, the exhibition will include more than 100 works by a remarkable group of Sienese artists. It will feature paintings alongside sculptures, metalwork, and textiles, ranging from large works made for public display to intimate objects created for private devotion. Although none of these artists survived the plague of circa 1350, their achievements had an immeasurable impact on painters and theorists in the centuries that followed.

This first solo exhibition of Sully’s groundbreaking production highlights recent Met acquisitions and loans from the Mary Sully Foundation, works that complicate traditional notions of Native American and modern art. Working without patronage, in near obscurity, and largely self-taught, Sully produced intricately designed and vividly colored drawings. They mix meaningful aspects of her Dakota heritage with visual elements observed from other Native nations as well as the aesthetics of urban life. Euro-American celebrities from popular culture, politics, and religion inspired some of her most striking works, which she called “personality prints”— abstract portraits arranged as vertical triptychs. Featuring 25 rarely seen Sully compositions, as well as archival family material and other Native items from The Met collection,Mary Sully: Native Modernoffers a fresh and complex lens through which to consider American art and life in the early 20th century.

2024,Mexican Prints at the Vanguard,"September 12, 2024–January 5, 2025",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/mexican-prints-at-the-vanguard,"The rich tradition of printmaking in Mexico—from the eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century—is explored in this exhibition of works drawn mainly from The Met collection. Among the early works presented are those by Mexico’s best-known printmaker, José Guadalupe Posada, whose depictions of skeletons engaged in different activities helped establish a global identity for Mexican art. Following the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), printmaking proved to be the ideal medium for artists wanting to address social and political concerns and voice resistance to the rise of fascism around the world. Artists also turned to printmaking to reproduce Mexican murals from the 1920s and to create exhibition posters, prints for the popular press, and portfolios celebrating Mexican dress and customs. Featuring over 130 works, including woodcuts, lithographs, and screen prints, by artists such as Posada, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and Leopoldo Méndez, the exhibition explores how prints were central to the artistic identity and practice in Mexico and highlights their effectiveness in addressing social and political issues, a role of the graphic arts that continues today. The bulk of The Met’s expansive collection came through the French-born artist Jean Charlot, whose association with the Museum began in the late 1920s. Charlot donated many of his own prints and works by other artists to The Met, and in the mid-1940s acted on behalf of the Museum to acquire prints in Mexico. The collection demonstrates The Met’s early interest in Mexican art and culture at a time when there was growing international interest in the subject.

In addition to over two thousand objects, his estate donated a library of more than 350 titles—roughly five hundred volumes in total—to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The contents of the library reflect his belief that design education and inspiration could come from every medium. His library and collected objects provided the staff at Tiffany access to works of art, cultures, and ideas far beyond the temporal and geographic boundaries of New York City. His interests were wide ranging and his library covers topics related to his collecting, as well as architecture and archeology, art education, home decoration and furniture, lace and textiles, book binding, illuminated manuscripts, and color theory.

Dedicated art teachers support students’ creativity and help them look closely in order to respond to their worlds through art making. As students take art classes from one year to the next, they increase their understanding of art, sharpen their skills, and learn to harness their imaginations for artistic expression. This exhibition celebrates the students’ journeys and discoveries from early childhood to young adulthood. Moreover, the text accompanying all student artwork is evidence of the reflective nature of art making.  A panel of arts specialists from New York City Public Schools and Studio in a School selected 228 semifinalists from nearly 1,300 submissions.

2024,The African Origin of Civilization,"December 14, 2021–October 6, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/african-origin-of-civilization,"Scholars today recognize Africa as the source of our common ancestry. But in 1974, Senegalese scholar and humanist Cheikh Anta Diop shocked and challenged historians by asserting the influence of ancient African civilizations in his groundbreaking bookThe African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality. This exhibition pays homage to Diop by presenting masterpieces from the Museum’s collections from west and central Africa alongside art from ancient Egypt for the first time in The Met’s history. Through twenty-one pairings of works from different African cultures and eras, this exhibition provides a rare opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary creativity of the continent across five millennia, revealing unexpected parallels and contrasts. Although there was no contact between their creators, the works share deep and underrecognized histories. The African Origin of Civilizationwill remain on view while The Met’s galleries of Sub-Saharan African Art are closed for thecomplete renovationof the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing. The re-envisioned wing is expected to reopen in 2024, and will feature three distinct suites of galleries for Sub-Saharan African Art, Ancient American Art, and Oceanic Art. See more works featured as part of The African Origin of Civilization initiative in other permanent collection galleries including:European Paintings (Gallery 601),Islamic Art (Galleries 455, 456),Medieval Art (Gallery 304),The American Wing (Gallery 753)and,The Robert Lehman Collection (Galleries 957, 964).

2024,Human/Nature: Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints,"June 13–September 23, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/human-nature-selections-from-the-department-of-drawings-and-prints,"The Department of Drawings and Prints boasts more than one million drawings, prints, and illustrated books made in Europe and the Americas from around 1400 to the present day. Because of their number and sensitivity to light, the works can only be exhibited for a limited period and are usually housed in on-site storage facilities. To highlight the vast range of works on paper, the department organizes four rotations a year in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery. Each installation is the product of a collaboration among curators and consists of up to 100 objects grouped by artist, technique, style, period, or subject. Featuring works on paper from the sixteenth to the twenty-first century, this rotation traces artists’ perceptions of human society, the natural world, and interactions between the two. Human nature is examined through a group of Netherlandish prints illustrating proverbs, while notions of family and artistic kinship frame a selection of works by seventeenth-century French printmaker Claudine Bouzonnet Stella. The complex relationship between animal and human qualities is explored via Eugène Delacroix’s depictions of lions. Other works on view reveal humans acting on their environments, as in representations of building activities in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italy. Natural history drawings of shells, flowers, and insects, as well as cut-paper collages of plant life, show how artists both carefully studied nature and attempted to control or possess it. Finally, the assertion of nature and its impact on humanity is registered by groupings of seascapes and prints depicting flooding in the United States over the past two hundred years. "
2024,Don't Forget to Call Your Mother,"December 18, 2023–September 15, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/don-t-forget-to-call-your-mother,"At a time when photographs are primarily shared and saved digitally, many artists are returning to the physicality of snapshots in an album or pictures in an archive as a source of inspiration. Drawing its title,Don’t Forget to Call Your Mother, from a photograph by Italian provocateur Maurizio Cattelan, the exhibition consists of works in The Met collection from the 1970s to today that reflect upon the complicated feelings of nostalgia and sentimentality that these objects conjure, while underlining the power of the found object. Among the featured artists is Sadie Barnette, for whom photographs provide a portal to illuminate the forgotten history of the first Black-owned gay bar in San Francisco and her own father’s life as her 2022 workPhoto Barpowerfully illustrates. Like Barnette, many of the artists in the exhibition seek to fortify the legacy of family histories, to emphasize the importance of intergenerational relationships, and to consider the ways in which knowledge and respect for the past can inform our current moment. Some artists such as Sophie Calle and Larry Sultan explore their own narratives to reveal the construction of desire, while others including Taryn Simon and Hank Willis Thomas examine histories that have shaped cultural and political dialogue. For some, including Darrel Ellis who utilized family pictures to negotiate the trauma of police violence, the personal is political. Deploying various strategies, these artists consider how a collection of images—like a talisman or an altarpiece—build relationships across time and can transform our understanding of the present.  The exhibition is made possible by Joyce Frank Menschel."
2024,Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,"May 10–September 2, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/sleeping-beauties-reawakening-fashion,"The Costume Institute’s spring 2024 exhibition, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, reactivates the sensory capacities of masterworks in the Museum’s collection through first-hand research, conservation analysis, and diverse technologies—from cutting-edge tools of artificial intelligence and computer-generated imagery to traditional formats of x-rays, video animation, light projection, and soundscapes.  When an item of clothing enters the Costume Institute collection, its status is changed forever. What was once a vital part of a person’s life is now a motionless ‘artwork’ that can no longer be worn or heard, touched, or smelled. This exhibition reanimates these objects, helping us experience them as they were originally intended—with vibrancy, dynamism, and life.  The exhibition features approximately 220 garments and accessories spanning four centuries, all visually connected through themes of nature, which also serves as a metaphor for the transience of fashion. Visitors will be invited to smell the aromatic histories of hats bearing floral motifs; to touch the walls of galleries that will be embossed with the embroidery of select garments; and to experience—via the illusion technique known as Pepper’s ghost—how the “hobble skirt” restricted women’s stride in the early 20th century. Punctuating the galleries will be a series of “sleeping beauties”—garments that can no longer be dressed on mannequins due to their extreme fragility.

2024,The Real Thing: Unpackaging Product Photography,"March 11–August 4, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-real-thing-unpackaging-product-photography,"The photographs in this exhibition do not depict rare or special things. They show toothpaste, tombstones, and hats. But these familiar trappings of everyday life will be, at times, unrecognizable—so altered by the camera as to constitute something entirely new. Enticing consumers with increasingly experimental approaches to the still life genre, the photographs featured transform everyday objects into covetable commodities. The camera abstracts them from functional use, at times distorting them through dizzying perspectives and modulations of scale. Spanning the first century of photographic advertising, the exhibition will illustrate how commercial camerawork contributed to the visual language of modernism, suggesting new links between the promotional strategies of vernacular studios and the tactics of the interwar avant-garde. Corporate commissions by celebrated innovators, including Paul Outerbridge, August Sander, and Piet Zwart, will appear alongside obscure catalogues and trade publications, united by a common cause: to snatch the ordinary out of context, and sell it back at full price.  The exhibition is made possible by The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, Inc."
2024,The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism,"February 25–July 28, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-harlem-renaissance-and-transatlantic-modernism,"The groundbreaking exhibitionThe Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernismexplores the comprehensive and far-reaching ways in which Black artists portrayed everyday modern life. Through some 160 works of painting, sculpture, photography, film, and ephemera, explore the new Black cities that took shape in the 1920s–40s in New York City’s Harlem and nationwide in the early decades of the Great Migration, when millions of African Americans began to move away from the segregated rural South. The first art museum survey of the subject in New York City since 1987, the exhibition establishes the Harlem Renaissance and its radically new development of the modern Black subject as central to the development of international modern art.  Featured artists include Charles Alston, Aaron Douglas, Meta Warrick Fuller, William H. Johnson, Archibald Motley, Winold Reiss, Augusta Savage, James Van Der Zee, and Laura Wheeler Waring. These artists are shown in direct juxtaposition with portrayals of international African diasporan subjects by European counterparts ranging from Henri Matisse, Edvard Munch, and Pablo Picasso to Germaine Casse, Jacob Epstein, and Ronald Moody.  A significant percentage of the paintings, sculpture, and works on paper on view in the exhibition come from the extensive collections of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including Clark Atlanta University Art Museum, Fisk University Galleries, Hampton University Art Museum, and Howard University Gallery of Art. Other major lenders include the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, with pending loans from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The exhibition includes loans from significant private collections and major European lenders.

Drawing largely from the American Wing’s varied collections, the display investigates the vibrant cosmopolitan and modern art world that emerged in the city during the post-Civil War years, laying the groundwork for today’s international cultural capital. Some fifty paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative objects highlight late nineteenth-century aesthetic innovations and trends, as well as leading American artists’ roles as tastemakers, organizers, exhibitors, and collaborators. Among those represented are Cecilia Beaux, Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Charles Ethan Porter, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Louis Comfort Tiffany, and Candace Wheeler.

2024,Emulating Books: Book Objects from the Lynn and Bruce Heckman Gift,"April 18–July 16, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/emulating-books-book-objects-from-the-lynn-and-bruce-heckman-gift,"Creating objects in book form has been an artistic practice for a millennium. These personal, inventive objects are ubiquitous in many cultures. They have been made for various purposes by people from all walks of life and skill levels. Whether precious or plain, useful or symbolic, they all benefit from their connection to the book. For example, the book-style relic of the ship Eurydice, which sank in 1878, killing over 300 sailors, was carved from a piece of the ship, and serves as an emblem documenting the history of the event, as well as a memorial book honoring the dead. An object made in the form of a book translates the meaning of the type of book it emulates, therefore imbuing the object with the emotional, material, or spiritual values of the original or imagined book. These objects can express feelings of love, enlightenment, humor and faith, and sometimes the mere experience of holding a book object, as with a treasured tome, can comfort its owner, as in the case of the solid wood Holy Bible which will never open, but comforts just the same. As a result of the book’s power, traditions of making specific types of book objects, such as book safes and game boards, have evolved and flourished. Examples of these traditions, made during the eighteenth to twentieth centuries can be seen in this exhibition. The Heckman collection is a gift to the Thomas J. Watson Library from Lynn Geringer Heckman, who began collecting objects in book form with her late husband Bruce Heckman in 1989, eventually amassing over 1,000 works. The Watson gift is a select group chosen from the larger collection. The objects on display will be available for consultation in our Reading Room at the conclusion of the exhibition.

2024,Anxiety and Hope in Japanese Art,"April 8, 2023–July 14, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/anxiety-hope-in-japanese-art,"Drawn largely from The Met’s renowned collection of Japanese art, this exhibition explores the twin themes of anxiety and hope, with a focus on the human stories in and around art and art making. The exhibition begins with sacred images from early Japan that speak to concerns about death, dying, and the afterlife or that were created in response to other uncertainties, such as war and natural disaster. The presentation then proceeds chronologically, highlighting medieval Buddhist images of paradises and hells, Zen responses to life and death, depictions of war and pilgrimage, and the role of protective and hopeful images in everyday life. In the final galleries, the exhibition’s underlying themes are explored through a selection of modern woodblock prints, garments, and photographs.

2024,Hidden Faces: Covered Portraits of the Renaissance,"April 2–July 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/hidden-faces-covered-portraits-of-the-renaissance,"This exhibition is the first to examine an intriguing but largely unknown side—in the literal sense—of Renaissance painting: multisided portraits in which the sitter’s likeness was concealed by a hinged or sliding cover, within a box, or by a dual-faced format. The covers and reverses of these small, private portraits were adorned with puzzlelike emblems, epigrams, allegories, and mythologies that celebrated the sitter’s character, and they represent some of the most inventive and unique secular imagery of the Renaissance. The viewer had to decode the meaning of the symbolic portrait before lifting, sliding, or turning the image over to unmask the face below. This widespread tradition in Italy and Northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries will be explored through approximately 60 double-sided and covered portraits from The Met collection and other American and European institutions, including the reunion of several portraits and their covers that had been split and made part of separate collections. Painted by artists such as Hans Memling, Lucas Cranach, Lorenzo Lotto, and Titian, the works range from portraits intended as portable propaganda to those designed to conceal a lover's identity. These varied three-dimensional, hand-held ensembles shed significant light upon the intimate and personal nature of portraits designed as interactive objects. The exhibition is made possible by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, the Robert Lehman Foundation, and the Mellon Foundation. The catalogue is made possible by the Drue E. Heinz Fund."
2024,Bélizaire and the Frey Children,"October 12, 2023–July 1, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/belizaire-and-the-frey-children,"Bélizaire and the Frey Childrenis a rare American portrait of an enslaved Black subject depicted with the family of his enslaver. Attributed to the leading French émigré portraitist working in 1830s–50s New Orleans, the painting illuminates the complex relationships of intimacy and inhumanity that defined domestic enslavement. The portrait’s later history also reveals the consequential afterlives of slavery. At the turn of the twentieth century, the prominent depiction of the enslaved Afro-Creole teenager, Bélizaire (ca. 1822–after 1860), who is positioned against a Louisiana landscape above the three young Frey siblings presumably in his care, was deliberately concealed—likely by a member of the Frey family. His figure was only revealed after a careful conservation treatment. Archival research has also recovered the identities and some of the histories of all four subjects. Bélizaire survived the Civil War and lived to experience freedom. Both Frey sisters died the same year the portrait was painted, their brother some nine years later."
2024,Weaving Abstraction in Ancient and Modern Art,"March 5–June 16, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/weaving-abstraction-in-ancient-and-modern-art,"The process of creating textiles has long been a springboard for artistic invention. InWeaving Abstraction in Ancient and Modern Art, two extraordinary bodies of work separated by at least 500 years are brought together to explore the striking connections between artists of the ancient Andes and those of the 20th century. The exhibition displays textiles by four distinguished modern practitioners—Anni Albers, Sheila Hicks, Lenore Tawney, and Olga de Amaral—alongside pieces by Andean artists from the first millennium BCE to the 16th century.  Featuring more than 50 works, including major loans and new acquisitions, this cross-historical exhibition offers new insights into the emergence of abstract imagery. The constructive nature of weavings, arising from the grid formed by the vertical and horizontal elements of the loom, prompted the formal investigation of geometric designs that emphasize the integral relationship between structure and design in the textiles. Each of the four modern artists featured developed innovative approaches to an ancient medium through deep study of Andean techniques. Shown together, these ancient and modern weavings reposition the place of textiles in global art history.  This exhibition will be accompanied by an issue ofThe Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin.  The exhibition is made possible by The Modern Circle.

2024,Vision and Verse: The Poetry of Chinese Painting,"February 3–June 16, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/vision-and-verse-the-poetry-of-chinese-painting,"Poetry and painting are deeply intertwined in Chinese culture. Many painters took ancient poetry as their inspiration, either directly illustrating famous verses or attempting to evoke them more subtly in the mind of the viewer. The poetic tradition, which reaches back over two millennia, provided these artists with a rich wellspring from which to draw, including verses on nature, religion, and ancient ritual and customs. For painters who were themselves poets, one of the greatest ambitions was to create a work that combined their original poetry, calligraphy, and painting into a coherent artwork, known as the “three perfections” in Chinese—a chance to stand on the shoulders of their poetic heroes and add their voice to the tradition. This exhibition explores some of the ways in which Chinese painters engaged with poetry to build connections and develop layers of meaning in their art. Featuring 90 works drawn almost entirely from The Met’s collection, the exhibition presents a selection of painting, calligraphy, and decorative arts. Spanning works inspired by ancient Chinese poetry such as the Book of Odes (Shijing), poetry of the Tang Dynasty, Chan/Zen Buddhist poetry, and more, the exhibition examines the ways in which the image and the verse inspired and impacted one another over time. ""There is a saying: ‘Poetry is formless painting; painting, poetry in form.’ Wise men have often talked of this idea, and it has been my guide. Thus, on idle days, I leaf through ancient and modern poetry of the Jin and Tang, finding beautiful lines that give full expression to the feelings that pass through men’s hearts and the scenes before their eyes."" —Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090), translation after Susan Bush and Hsio-yen Shih The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund. #MetChineseArt"

Thanks to recent advancements in printing techniques, artists could create colorful, inventive compositions that seamlessly integrated text and images. Recognizing the broad appeal of this novel art form, the publishing industry began commissioning sophisticated placards to advertise magazines, journals, books, and other types of literature. Though short-lived, the so-called literary poster had a lasting impact on illustration, graphic design, and marketing in the United States.  This exhibition will present more than 40 highlights from The Met’s outstanding collection of literary posters, developed over four decades through the vision and support of Leonard A. Lauder. With a focus on innovations in style and technique, it will feature works by the leading American poster artists of the day, including Will H. Bradley, Joseph Christian Leyendecker, Edward Penfield, and Ethel Reed.  Accompanied by a catalogue.  This publication has been made possible by a generous grant from Leonard A. Lauder."

It is an art form literally of land and place, and is one of America’s ancient Indigenous creative expressions. Foregrounding Pueblo voices and aesthetics,Grounded in Clay: The Spirit of Pueblo Potteryis the first community-curated Native American exhibition in the history of The Met. The effort features more than one hundred historical, modern, and contemporary clay works and offers a critical understanding of Pueblo pottery as community-based knowledge and personal experience. Dating from the eleventh century to the present day, the featured artworks represent the aesthetic lineages of New Mexico’s nineteen Río Grande Pueblos as well as the West Texas community of Ysleta del Sur and the Hopi tribe of Arizona—sovereign Indigenous nations where pots and other ceramic works have been made and used for millennia. Visual and material languages of pottery and intergenerational narratives are highlighted throughout the exhibition.

Born in Iran in 1971, Nairy Baghramian fled to Berlin, Germany, in 1984, where she continues to live and work. Baghramian creates abstract sculptures that explore the dynamics of the body, gender, and dichotomies of private and public space. Her site-responsive sculptures and installations engage with architecture and often evoke bodily gestures, junctures, or fragments. Along with site responsivity, other hallmarks of Baghramian’s work are polychromy and the innovative and subversive use of different types of material.

The works exhibited span the 1920s through 1980s and reflect a range of languages, countries of origin, movements, groups, and styles including Constructivism, Concrete art, Neo-Dada, Lettrism, Situationism, Actionism, and Fluxus.  This exhibition features iconic publications of international 20th century avant-garde book design and contemporary art, as well as less-widely known trends and movements. Previously absent or underrepresented not only within Watson but in U.S. art institutions overall, these latter publications have been newly acquired by Watson to encourage new scholarship, development, and dissemination of more expansive art histories.  Despite the diverse circumstances, places, and time periods in which they were published, the works exhibited here share several distinguishing attributes: a playful, innovative subversion of established conventions, materials, and processes for book design and production; dynamic uses of handwriting, letterforms, and typography as visually expressive elements in themselves; and aspirations among their creators to exploit the power of print to awaken, disrupt, inform, inspire, improve, and enrich everyday life for their local communities and the world at large.

2024,"British Vision, 1700–1900: Selections from the Department of Drawings and Prints","December 7, 2023–March 5, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/british-vision-1700-1900-selections-from-the-department-of-drawings-and-prints,"This rotation celebrates recent additions to the collection by British artists who worked across two centuries, from 1700 to 1900. Landscape is a focus here, with the genre becoming closely allied to the growing popularity of watercolor during this period. Around 1760, artists like Paul and Thomas Sandby, Francis Towne, and Thomas Jones began to explore the medium’s expressive potential. In the nineteenth century, dedicated watercolor societies were established and held regular exhibitions to promote their members’ work. Increasingly developed and poetically resonant compositions sought to challenge the preeminence of oil painting.  In this display, watercolors made rapidly out of doors by John Constable and Peter De Wint may be compared to finished compositions by John Brett, Samuel Palmer, and Alfred William Hunt. Travel’s ability to spur creativity is demonstrated by works that respond to sites in Britain, France, Italy, Caucasia, and North Africa. Nature studies, conversely, affirm how foreign flora became increasingly available at home. Finally, the sustained importance of the figure is represented by early chalk and pastel renderings by Joseph Wright of Derby and Allan Ramsay, vibrantly colored later portraits by David Wilkie and John Frederick Lewis, and representations of Black models by Lewis, William Henry Hunt, and Simeon Solomon."

2024,"A Magical Menagerie: Exploring Dragons, Griffins, Unicorns, and More at The Met Cloisters","January 18–February 13, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/a-magical-menagerie,"Animals, both real and imagined, make frequent appearances in medieval art. They are included in artworks as decorative elements, cultural and religious symbols, and as a reflection of the natural world. As part of The Met Cloisters’ commitment to serving neighbors in upper Manhattan, in fall 2023, fourth grade students from P. S. 48 PO Michael J. Buczek explored the mythical beasts of The Met Cloisters and responded by creating their own modern medieval creatures.  During two visits to The Met Cloisters, students noticed a griffin peering over a stone doorway, a dragon with a tightly coiled tail painted on a wall, and a magical unicorn woven into showstopping tapestries. They considered how medieval artworks were made and what materials were used, from pigments made from stones to threads made of silver and gold. The young artists also examined how these artworks tell stories about medieval communities, religious beliefs, and inspire creative storytelling today.  Back in the classroom, the students designed their own imagined creatures. Exploring new materials, they drew, blended, and painted to create their creatures and their habitats. On view here at The Met Cloisters, their works of art combine different elements of real and mythical animals to form beasts with qualities that range from fearsome and ferocious to cute and kind—reflecting what the artists themselves might want to find in a magical creature.  The Met Cloisters gratefully acknowledges P. S. 48 art teacher Félix Portela, Met teaching artist Damian Quiñones, and the entire P. S. 48 community for their support of this program."
2024,"Rich Man, Poor Man: Art, Class, and Commerce in a Late Medieval Town","March 6, 2023–February 4, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/rich-man-poor-man,"Below the monarch, nobility, and land-owning gentry in the highly stratified society of sixteenth-century England stood those known as the “middling sort.” Like their compatriots of higher rank, they too saw art and architecture as a means of self-fashioning. This exhibition examines the emergence of distinctly middle-class taste in late medieval England by showcasing a rare set of large-scale domestic sculptures from Exeter. Commissioned by a merchant named Henry Hamlyn, the sculptures, which adorned the exterior of his house, feature stock characters drawn from popular prints and bawdy tales: a jester, a quarreling couple, peasants, and musicians. Rustic in style and subject matter, they fascinatingly came across as figures both amusing and menacing. With over fifty works, including textiles, prints, furnishings, and other decorative arts,Rich Man, Poor Manexplores why Hamlyn might have been drawn to such imagery. It also highlights how the home, both inside and out, could serve as a form of individual self-expression and a statement of social order. The exhibition is made possible by the Michel David-Weill Fund.

2024,"Victorian Masterpieces from the Museo de Arte de Ponce, Puerto Rico","October 8, 2022–February 4, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/victorian-masterpieces-from-the-museo-de-arte-de-ponce-puerto-rico,"This special installation will feature five Victorian masterpieces from the collection of the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Puerto Rico. The exceptional loans include the iconicFlaming Juneby Frederic Leighton, John Everett Millais’sThe Escape of a Heretic, 1559, and Edward Burne-Jones’s Small Briar Rose series (The Prince Enters the Wood,The King and His Court, andThe Sleeping Beauty, all painted 1871–73). The paintings will be displayed in the galleries for 19th- and early-20th-century European paintings and sculpture, presented in dialogue with other works by artists at The Met. Most notably, the presentation will bring together Leighton’sFlaming JunewithLachrymae(1894–95, The Met), two of his last monumental oil paintings. Although the two works have been in several exhibitions together, this is the first time that they will be displayed side by side. Since the Museo de Arte de Ponce has been closed for repair following devastating earthquakes in 2020, this partnership allows the public to continue viewing their most important artworks while also showcasing meaningful connections with The Met's collection.

2024,Baseball Cards from the Collection of Jefferson R. Burdick,"July 20, 2023–January 23, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/baseball-cards-from-the-collection-of-jefferson-r-burdick-2023,"An integral part of the Museum’s collection of ephemera, the Burdick collection of baseball cards tells the history of popular printmaking in the United States. In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum’s curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate in large batches his entire collection of more than 30,000 baseball cards—along with another 303,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters—to The Met. The baseball cards collected by Burdick represent the most comprehensive public collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. This exhibition features nearly one hundred cards produced between 1887 and 1959. Collectively, they illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era, at the turn of the nineteenth century, through the golden age and modern era of the sport. Produced using various types of media—from photography to lithography—the cards feature legends of the game as well as lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game."
2024,"Vertigo of Color: Matisse, Derain, and the Origins of Fauvism","October 13, 2023–January 21, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/vertigo-of-color,"Over an intense nine weeks in the summer of 1905 in the modest fishing village of Collioure on the French Mediterranean, Henri Matisse and Andre Derain embarked on a partnership that led to a wholly new, radical artistic language later known as Fauvism. Their daring, energetic experiments with color, form, structure, and perspective changed the course of French painting; it marked an introduction to early modernism and introduced Matisse’s first important body of work in his long career. This exhibition, which is co-organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, emphasizes as never before the legacy of that summer and examines the paintings, drawings, and watercolors of Matisse and Derain through sixty-five works on loan from national and international museums, including Musée National d’Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou; National Galleries of Scotland; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and the Museum of Modern Art, New York; as well as private collections. With this new direction in painting, Matisse and Derain manipulated color in radical ways—nature took on hues responding to the artists’ sensations rather than reality. At the Salon d’Automne in 1905, when Matisse and Derain unveiled their controversial canvases, a prominent French journalist labeled them “les Fauves,” or wild beasts. Accompanied by a catalogue. The exhibition is made possible by The Florence Gould Foundation. Additional support is provided by an Anonymous Foundation.

2024,Proof: Maxime Du Camp’s Photographs of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa,"October 23, 2023–January 21, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/proof-maxime-du-camp,"In October 1849, twenty-seven-year-old Maxime Du Camp—an aspiring journalist with big ambitions—left Paris to photograph sites across the eastern Mediterranean. Officially encouraged to exploit photography’s “uncontestable exactitude,” he returned to France a year and a half later with more than 200 paper negatives, from which 125 were selected to illustrateEgypte, Nubie, Palestine et Syrie(1852). This work, the first photographically illustrated book published in France, arguably established an aesthetic standard for documentary photography: its salted paper prints are rendered in cool, gradated tones that one contemporary critic described as “vaporous gray.” The published photographs stand in stark contrast to several sets (each unique) that Du Camp privately printed before planning his book. These “proof prints” are noteworthy for their surprising range of warm colors, handwork, and a luminescence that recalls their Mediterranean origin. Unlike the book’s focus on monuments and ancient ruins, they also provide evidence of modern civilization in unfamiliar, arid landscapes.Proofis the first exhibition to focus on The Met’s collection of these earlier prints, including previously unseen and unpublished views from a portfolio and a small, handbound album. Offering an exceptional opportunity to compare these photographs to those published in 1852, the exhibition reveals that Du Camp’s ultimate project did not present objective proof of its Mediterranean subject, but rather a complicated view shaped by personal ambition, emergent technology, and the taste and temperament of its nineteenth-century European audience.

2024,Picasso: A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn,"September 14, 2023–January 14, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/picasso-cubist-commission,"In 1910 Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) embarked on a decorative commission for the Brooklyn residence of artist, collector, and critic Hamilton Easter Field (1873–1922), whom he had met in Paris the year before. The artist’s brief called for as many as eleven panels to line the walls of Field’s home library and form an enveloping aesthetic whole. The proposed room offered Picasso his first opportunity to move beyond easel painting and apply his radical Cubist style to decorative painting formats of challenging size and proportion. Working from his studio in France, the artist completed a group of figure and still life compositions, but the commission was never realized. The exhibition is the first to present this little-known chapter of Picasso’s Cubist period and provides an occasion to consider Cubism in relation to decorative painting conventions and architectural space. It brings together six extant canvas panels and related works, as well as archival material on Field, Picasso, and the site of the commission. Accompanied by a catalogue. Picasso: A Cubist Commission in Brooklynis the second in a series of focused research exhibitions under the auspices of the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art.

2024,"Artists of the Holocaust: Portfolios, Exhibition Catalogs, and Monographs","April 20, 2023–January 9, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/holocaust-artist,"This exhibition features a selection of Watson Library’s collection of works by and about artists of the Holocaust. It includes graphic images of concentration camps and depictions of human suffering. Exhibition note: Library hours vary from regular Museum hours. Before your visit, please consult library hourshere. Featuring more than twenty five publications reproducing art created in the concentration camps and soon after liberation,Artists of the Holocausttestifies to the atrocities, the artists’ indomitable will to document their experiences, and the power of publications to educate and inform. The exhibition consists of postwar portfolios from the 1940s; personal illustrated narratives from the 1940s through the 1970s; exhibition catalogs; books featuring children’s art created in Theresienstadt; and Tana Kellner’s powerful artists’ book,71125,Fifty Years of Silence: Eva Kellner’s Story(1992). The exhibition additionally presents work by Holocaust survivors Leo Haas (1901–1983), Esther Lurie (1913– 1998), and Simon Wiesenthal (1908–2005), among others. Watson Library has actively developed our collection on artists of the Holocaust for the past fifteen years. A landmark 1978 exhibition catalog published by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations,Spiritual Resistance: Art from Concentration Camps, 1940–1945: a Selection of Drawings and Paintings from the Collection of Kibbutz Lohamei Haghetaot, Israel,served as the foundational guide to enhancing our collection. The list of artists exhibited provided an initial checklist to develop the library’s holdings in this area. Tom Freudenheim, former director of the Baltimore Museum of Art, which was one of the venues, contributed an essay to the catalog, “Art from Concentration Camps” that set an example on how to approach this material. In 2020, the library received an important donation on Judaica and Jewish history from Freudenheim, including numerous publications on art from concentration camps."
2024,"The Great Hall Commission: Jacolby Satterwhite,A Metta Prayer","October 2, 2023–January 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/jacolby-satterwhite,"For the second in a series of commissions for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Great Hall, interdisciplinary artist Jacolby Satterwhite (born Columbia, South Carolina, 1986) has transformed the historic space with a site-specific multimedia installation. TitledA Metta Prayer, the project fuses choreography, video, animation, lighting, and music to imagine a kaleidoscopic, computer-generated world within The Met’s Great Hall. The installation features live performances on select dates by the artist’s collaborators including Hairbone (Raul de Nieves with Jessie Stead), Ioanna Gika, KelseyLu, Kindness, Lafawndah with Nightfeelings, Patrick Belaga, serpentwithfeet, and Ahya Simone. Satterwhite’s ambitious installation at The Met is the result of a highly technical creative practice involving a myriad of software platforms and emergent technologies. Projected onto the walls of the Great Hall, the six-channel video features more than 70 animated objects from The Met collection that populate an imagined digital architecture. Live action sequences captured in three dimensions feature collaborators—including Solange, KelseyLu, and Moses Sumney and drag performers like queer wrestling group Choke Hole—as characters within his narrative. Satterwhite animates these elements together with computer-generated imagery, applying the logic of video games to his unique virtual world. At a time when Black and LGBTQ+ communities face continued threats of violence, A Metta Prayer constructs a digital space that expresses love, joy, and resilience. Satterwhite draws inspiration from the Buddhist Metta prayer, a mantra of loving-kindness, to build a narrative that rebels against the conventions of commercial video games. Rather than perpetuating violence, the characters in A Metta Prayer dance, perform, preach, and pose. Scenes inspired by endless runner platform games, in which players move forward, gain points, and avoid obstacles, show characters collecting mantra “coins” to achieve enlightenment. Encounters with police result in dance flash mobs. Heroines ascend from a dystopian city to a cloud-filled sky teeming with life. Throughout the 21-minute video cycle, Satterwhite deploys mindful repetition as a formal principle, linking the video’s rhythm to the recurrent nature of the Metta mantra. A soundtrack produced by PAT (Jacolby Satterwhite, Patricia Satterwhite, Nightfeelings, and Patrick Belaga) pulses with energy, providing the video with its driving beat. The commission is made possible by Cynthia Hazen Polsky and Leon B. Polsky, and The Director’s Fund. Additional support is provided by Sarah Arison, the Adrienne Arsht Fund for Resilience through Art, the Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman Fund, Peter Steinberg and Kathrine Gehring, and Helen Lee Warren and David Warren.

2024,The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Met,"May 24, 2021–January 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/good-life-collecting-late-antique-art,"The Good Life: Collecting Late Antique Art at The Metshowcases the Museum’s important and rare collection of third- to eighth-century art from Egypt and reevaluates it through the lens of late antique ideas about abundance, virtue, and shared classical taste. Writers and craftspeople translated these ideas into a concept celebrated as the “the good life.” Anchored by crucial gifts to The Met of late antique art, the exhibition explores themes connected to social status, wealth, and living well in Late Antiquity. The core of The Met’s collection from late antique Egypt was formed through public subscriptions and generous gifts in the 1890s. The first decades after the Museum’s founding was a time when profound interest in the earliest Christian art inspired scholars, collectors, and the public alike. Today, The Met continues to collect late antique art that reveals the burgeoning of literary and visual representations of a life well lived. This exhibition highlights The Met’s holdings of late antique textiles, decorative arts, jewelry, and sculpture—all highly prized by elite patrons of the Byzantine Empire’s southern provinces in Africa. The works of art featured in the exhibition reflect the extraordinary wealth of Mediterranean Africa. In addition to marking status, these objects responded to such fundamental questions as, What does it mean to “live well”? During the period, ideas about “the good life” intersected with issues of religion, identity, and relationships with the past. As a result, these objects not only testify to The Met’s long-standing interest in late antique art of the region but also shed light on some of the aspirations, values, and lifestyles of its upper classes. #MetByzantine The exhibition is made possible by The Giorgi Family Foundation."

2024,Learning to Paint in Premodern China,"February 18, 2023–January 7, 2024",https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/learning-to-paint,"This exhibition will consider the underexplored question of how painters learned their craft in premodern China. Some painters learned at home, from fathers, mothers, or other relatives among whom painting was a shared language of familial communication. Others learned from friends who shared their passion. Still others turned to painting manuals, treatises that expanded knowledge of painting to anyone who could buy a woodblock-printed book. Paintings from The Met collection, along with a choice selection of important works from local private collectors, will illuminate these and other pathways to becoming a painter in premodern China. The exhibition will be presented in two rotations. Rotation 1:February 18–July 16, 2023Rotation 2:August 12, 2023–January 7, 2024 The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
